The column-krater is the favorite shape of Myson (see {{< q-abbr "*ARV*<sup>2</sup>" >}} 239–42, nos. 18–76; {{< q-abbr "*BAPD*" >}}, s.v. Myson; cf. [entry no. 2](/catalogue/2/) [73.AE.135]), and it has been suggested that he was one of the vase-painters responsible for reintroducing the shape into the Attic repertory (C. M. Cardon, “The Berlin Painter and His School” [Ph.D. diss., Institute of Fine Arts, New York University, 1977], p. 72; {{< q-abbr "Mannack, *Late Mannerists*" >}}, pp. 5, 50). The figural scenes are placed in panels as here or are unframed as in [entry no. 2](/catalogue/2/) (73.AE.135). For a similar scene and ornament as on A, cf. a column-krater by the same vase-painter in Boston, Museum of Fine Arts 1973.572 ({{< q-abbr "*ARV*<sup>2</sup>" >}} 1638.23 *bis*; {{< q-abbr "*Paralipomena*" >}} 349; {{< q-abbr "*Beazley Addenda*<sup>2</sup>" >}} 201; {{< q-abbr "Bron, “Chevaux et la Danse”" >}}, pl. 6.2).

Figures in black silhouette occur more frequently on the overhang of the rim; cf. [entry no. 12](/catalogue/12/) (81.AE.161). For rims decorated on top with figures in black silhouette, see K. Schauenburg, “Silene beim Symposion,” {{< q-abbr "*JdI*" >}} 88 (1973): 1–26, esp. 14–20; {{< q-abbr "Mannack, *Late Mannerists*" >}}, p. 63.

Youths leading horses is a popular theme in Attic vase-painting, but it is difficult to be sure which representations are connected with sport and which are not. Given that the scene on side B depicts an athletic subject, it is possible that the horses on side A could be part of an athletic competition as well. Horses played a prominent role in the ancient Greek world, and Xenophon wrote a treatise *On Horsemanship* in the early fourth century B.C. For a similar scene, see the krater noted above in Boston, Museum of Fine Arts 1973.572 and a column-krater by the Flying-Angel Painter in Lausanne, Private Collection ({{< q-abbr "Bron, “Chevaux et la Danse”" >}}, pl. 5). For a horse rendered in a similar way, cf. a column-krater in the manner of Myson in Berlin, Antikensammlung 31404 ({{< q-abbr "*ARV*<sup>2</sup>" >}}243.4; {{< q-abbr "*Beazley Addenda*<sup>2</sup>" >}} 202; {{< q-abbr "*CVA*" >}} Berlin 11 [Germany 86], pl. 5.2, 6.1).

Scenes of javelin throwing belong mainly to the palaestra scenes and become common from the last quarter of the sixth century B.C. onward.

Javelin throwing and jumping belong to the pentathlon. For the pentathlon, see [entry no. 2](/catalogue/2/) (73.AE.135).

The long jump appears frequently on Attic vases after the third quarter of the sixth century B.C. See {{< q-abbr "Goossens, Thielemans, and Thas, “Sport Scenes”" >}}: 75; {{< q-abbr "Legakis, “Athletic Contests”" >}}, pp. 276–317, cat. no. 9.

The *halteres* depicted here are of the Archaic type used in the sixth and fifth centuries B.C. Cf. the *halteres* on the column-kraters by Myson on Villa Giulia 984 (supra) and Villa Giulia 1044 ({{< q-abbr "*ARV*<sup>2</sup>" >}} 239.23; {{< q-abbr "*CVA*" >}} 2 [Italy 2], pl. 16.1.2); the stone *halteres* in Athens, National Museum 1926 ({{< q-abbr "*Mind and Body*" >}}, pp. 175–76, no. 66); a black-figure cup close to the Painter of Vatican G69 in Paris, Louvre Cp 10376 ({{< q-abbr "*ABV*" >}} 210.3; {{< q-abbr "*CVA*" >}} Louvre 10 [France 17], pl. 107.3.8); a lekythos by the Bowdoin Painter in Athens, National Museum 17281 ({{< q-abbr "*ARV*<sup>2</sup>" >}} 684.145; {{< q-abbr "*CVA*" >}} Athens 2 [Greece 2], pl. 12.6–7); a fragment of a kalpis by the Nikoxenos Painter in an English private collection ({{< q-abbr "*ARV*<sup>2</sup>" >}} 222.24; {{< q-abbr "Robertson, *Art of Vase-Painting*" >}}, p. 118, fig. 119).

For trainer (*paedotribes*), see {{< q-abbr "Kyle, *Athletics*" >}}, pp. 141–45.

Back views, introduced into vase-painting by the Pioneers, are often used by Myson. Cf. the akontists on the column-kraters Louvre CA 1947 (supra) and Villa Giulia 984 (supra); the *diskobolos* and komast on the column-krater Villa Giulia 1044 (supra); Herakles on the column-krater Florence 3981 (A. M. Esposito and G. de Tommaso, *Vasi Attici. Museo Archeologico Nazionale di Firenze Antiquarium* [Florence, 1993], p. 55, fig. 76). Cf. also the twisting poses and back views of the athletes in low relief on a kouros base in Athens, National Museum 3476 (A. Stewart, *Greek Sculpture* [New Haven, 1990], pp. 122–23, figs. 138–40); the boxer on the amphora by the Kleophrades Painter in Munich, Staatliche Antikensammlungen 2305 ({{< q-abbr "*ARV*<sup>2</sup>" >}} 121.3; {{< q-abbr "*CVA*" >}} Munich 4 [Germany 12], pl. 173.1). For the back view of the trainer on B, cf. also the three-quarter back view of the middle komast on the amphora Type A by Euthymides in Munich, Staatliche Antikensammlungen 2307 ({{< q-abbr "*ARV*<sup>2</sup>" >}} 26.1;1620; {{< q-abbr "*Agora* 30" >}}, p. 86). It is generally accepted that Myson learned to draw in the Pioneer workshop, and his vases recall Phintias, who may have been his master.

For nudity in ancient Greek athletics, see [entry no. 2](/catalogue/2/) (73.AE.135).

The hound appears to be intrigued or stricken by the athlete with the *halteres*, and he attends the training carefully. Dogs, an important element in the ancient Greek daily life, often appear in hunting scenes, but they also occur in palaestra, symposia, domestic or funeral contexts, and courtship scenes, without necessarily being an integral part of the composition or the narrative of the scene. It is during the late sixth and early fifth centuries B.C. that they meet their popularity in vase-painting. Cf. a fragmentary volute krater by the Syriskos Painter in Athens, National Museum ACR.758 ({{< q-abbr "*ARV*<sup>2</sup>" >}} 260.4; {{< q-abbr "*Mind and Body*" >}}, pp. 161–62, no. 47); a black-figure alabastron by the Theseus Painter in Palermo, Collezione Mormino 660 ({{< q-abbr "*CVA*" >}} Palermo, Collezione Mormino 1 [Italy 50], pl. 19.4–6); a pelike by the Triptolemos Painter in Malibu, J.

The Sphinx is usually depicted facing right. For examples facing left, cf. a cup by the Oedipous Painter in Vatican 16.541 ({{< q-abbr "*ARV*<sup>2</sup>" >}} 451.1; 1653–54; {{< q-abbr "*Paralipomena*" >}} 376; {{< q-abbr "*Beazley Addenda*<sup>2</sup>" >}} 119; I.

The Sphinx often appears seated on the top of an Ionic column. Cf. the cup by the Oedipous Painter in Vatican 16.541 ({{< q-abbr "*ARV*<sup>2</sup>" >}} 451.1; {{< q-abbr "*Paralipomena*" >}} 376; {{< q-abbr "*Beazley Addenda*<sup>2</sup>" >}} 242; {{< q-abbr "Moret, *Oedipe*" >}}, pls. 50–51.1). For the Sphinx seated on a column or rock, see {{< q-abbr "Moret, *Oedipe*" >}}, pp. 69–75.

The full face of the youth behind Oidipous clearly presents an expression of panic. His total frontality—body and face—also gives a sense of depth. He is very similar to Hermes depicted on a bell krater by the Persephone Painter in New York, Metropolitan Museum of Art 28.57.23 ({{< q-abbr "*ARV*<sup>2</sup>" >}} 1012.1; {{< q-abbr "*Paralipomena*" >}} 440; {{< q-abbr "*Beazley Addenda*<sup>2</sup>" >}} 314; E. Reeder in {{< q-abbr "*Pandora*" >}}, pp. 289–90, cat. no. 82). For another youth facing frontally in the scene with Oidipous and the Sphinx, see the column-krater by the Agrigento Painter, once in Potenza, Coll. Barone (supra).

According to J. R. Guy, the fragment should be associated with the fragments in a private collection (formerly on loan to Princeton, lent by Ariel Herrmann), all belonging to a volute-krater with an Amazonomachy. The helmet on this fragment may belong to the right-hand Greek warrior depicted on that krater. For those volute-krater fragments, see {{< q-abbr "Robertson, *Art of Vase-Painting*" >}}, p. 58; J. M. Padgett, in *In Celebration: Works of Art from the Collections of Princeton Alumni and Friends of The Art Museum, Princeton University*, ed. A. Rosenbaum (Princeton, 1997), p. 14, no. 11; Gaunt (supra) recognizes the scene as a Heraklean Amazonomachy.

## Provenance

77.AE.11: by 1971, Nicolas Koutoulakis (Geneva, Switzerland); –1977, Gordon McLendon (Dallas, Texas); 1977, donated to the J. Paul Getty Museum. On the reassembly of the krater, and the inclusion of fragments from the Musée du Louvre, see below.

The following fragments have not yet been incorporated into the reconstructed vase:

- 86.AE.587: –1986, Herbert Cahn (Basel, Switzerland); 1986, acquired by the J. Paul Getty Museum by exchange; a note with the fragment states: “H.A. Cahn, ex Thimme”; a number, 1673 in red, was removed prior to photography for the present publication; other Museum documentation gives the provenance as “Swiss Market (ex Koutoulakis).”
- 97.AE.58.2: by 1995–97, Robert Hecht (Atlantis Antiquities, New York); 1997, donated to the J. Paul Getty Museum.
- 98.AE.82.1–12: accessioned by the J. Paul Getty Museum during an inventory of the storeroom, 1998. These fragments have not as yet been identified with any dealer, donor, or collector.

The reconstructed vase includes a number of fragments on loan from the Musée du Louvre. They were once part of a volute-krater (Louvre G166) that was acquired from the Campana Collection in 1869. By 1922, Beazley had ascertained that a nineteenth-century restorer had created this vase from fragments of two different volute-kraters—one by the Kleophrades Painter ({{< q-abbr "*ARV*<sup>2</sup>" >}} 186, 51), the other by the Berlin Painter (Louvre Ca 10799, {{< q-abbr "*ARV*<sup>2</sup>" >}} 206, 129–30). The vase was disassembled in 1957. Part of the foot was subsequently identified as belonging to the Antaios krater by Euphronios (Louvre G103; {{< q-abbr "*ARV*<sup>2</sup>" >}} 14.2; see A. Pasquier, “Nouvelles découvertes à propos du cratère d’Antée peint par Euphronios,” *Revue du Louvre* 1 [1981]: 3–9).

The Louvre fragments were lent to the Getty in 1980 and 1982 (L.80.AE.80 and L.82.AE.33). They include a large fragment belonging to side B, showing running Amazons and most of the trumpeter, and the two Nereids running toward Nereus; the head of the standing female figure at far left of the Peleus-Thetis frieze; the lower part of fallen Amazon and pair of Amazons defending her, from the upper frieze of side A; part of Athena’s shield and Herakles’s head, from the lower frieze of side B; and the two handle fragments published in H. Giroux, “La cratère à volutes du peintre de Berlin au Louvre,” *Revue archéologique* 23 (1972): 243–50.

J. Gaunt has noted a fragment in the Museo Archeologico Etrusco in Florence (PD 507, {{< q-abbr "*ARV*<sup>2</sup>" >}} 187.52) that is likely to belong to this krater.

## Shape and Ornament

77.AE.11: Offset rim flares out slightly; upright cylindrical loop on each side of the shoulder, which supports the flanged handle that rises above the rim and terminates in a tight spiral after it attaches to the top side of the rim. Neck in two degrees, with the upper part offset from the lower; ovoid body; foot in two degrees, a fillet marked by a groove above and below joins the foot to the body. Top of rim reserved. Outer edge of rim on side A decorated with black squares outlined each twice by rectangles, alternating high and low between continuous right and left meanders. On side B, saltire squares and two black outlined squares, alternating high and low between right and left meanders. Row of short black tongues on body below the junction with neck. On reserved flanges of the handles, double lines frame running spirals with ivy leaves in the interstices. Between the flanges, the handles are black. Vertically addorsed palmettes at the roots of the handles. Body black, except for a reserved zone with black rays above the foot. Foot black, except for outside of upper degree, the resting surface, and underside. Interior black.

{ figure profile-19 }

86.AE.587: Two joining fragments from the lower zone of the neck on B. Black tongue pattern on shoulder below the junction with the body.

97.AE.58.2: Single fragment from the left side of the upper zone of the neck on side A.

98.AE.82.1–12: A group of twelve small fragments belonging to the neck of the vessel. Some joins, identified by An Jiang, are recorded below.

## Subject

A. Upper zone: Amazonomachy (partially preserved). At left, an Amazon carrying a wounded or dead companion to left out of the battle. Behind them is preserved the edge of a helmet’s crest. Most of the rest of the left half of the scene is missing. Here should be placed the upper torsos of the two Amazons moving to left preserved on fragment 97.AE.58.2; they are mounted as is indicated by the edge of the horse head preserved at the left end of the fragment and the thigh of the Amazon at the right. The latter is a hoplite with a helmet on her head and a round shield and spear in her hands; the Amazon at the left is dressed in Skythian costume and cap. The scene continues on 77.AE.11 with Telamonian Ajax (unnamed), in combat with Amazons occupying the center of the frieze. Ajax strides to left, dressed in a *chitoniskos* and armed with a round shield (bull as device), greaves, corselet, and Corinthian helmet with low crest decorated with double row of dots at the lower part. With his single-edged sword (*machaira*) he attacks a group of Amazons (two preserved) who confront him with spears. Next to Ajax stands Herakles in lionskin and *chitoniskos*, facing right. He grasps a fallen Amazon to deliver the final blow with his sword. A *gorytus* hangs at his side. The fallen Amazon wears a high-crested Attic helmet without decoration, holds a bow in her right hand, and grasps Herakles’s arm with the left hand. At the right, three pairs of fully armed Amazons move to the left to attack Herakles. The two Amazons at the far right are archers (98.AE.82.1 gives more of their legs and feet and the end of a quiver), the rest hoplites. One archer wears a Skythian cap; the rest of the Amazons wear greaves and helmets with crests decorated at their lower part with a double row of dots; the fallen Amazon and the first two attackers wear low-crested Attic helmets; the second pair and the first archer wear low-crested Chalcidian helmets. A centaur serves as the device on one Amazon’s round shield. The Amazon behind her holds a partially preserved Boiotian shield.

Inscriptions: KALO[S] to the right of the head of the Amazon carrying a companion. KALOS “L” between the heads of the standing Amazons attacking Ajax and Herakles.

Lower zone: The Labors of Herakles. The fragment 86.AE.587 should be placed on the left end of the figural frieze. It preserves the lower part of a female’s garment with the left foot, standing to right and the right foot of a figure to right. The female figure is probably Athena standing behind her protegé Herakles whose right foot can be recognized on the 86.AE.587 fragment and whose left foot is preserved on 77.AE.11. This is all that survives of the hero as he fights the Lernean Hydra, which is presented as a huge monster with nine snake heads; only four of the actual heads are fully/partially preserved while the rest preserve only a part the snake’s body. Iolaos (partially preserved; 98.AE.82.4 gives his head) stands on the right facing the creature and prepares to cauterize the stumps of the severed necks with the torch he holds in his right hand. He wears a helmet and greaves and holds a spear and shield (device: Pegasos) in his left hand. Behind him, Herakles in a lionskin fights the triple-bodied Geryon (only the upper part of his shield, the lower leg with greaves, and three left feet are preserved) with his club (only lower end preserved) in his right hand. The double-bodied dog Orthros lies dead on the ground by Herakles’s and Iolaos’s feet. Blood pours from Orthros’s wound. Eurytion, the cowherd of Geryon, lies on the ground between the hero and Geryon, having been shot in the abdomen by an arrow. Blood pours from his wound. Following another lost section of the frieze is Athena (only her low-crested helmet, left hand holding a shield, legs from the knee down with lower edges of her garment, and end of a spear are preserved), who serves as a transitional element between this and the next labor. The goddess sits facing right, but looks back toward Geryon. In front of Athena to the right, Herakles (lionskin, *gorytus*) holds his club in his left hand while with his right he picks the golden apples of the Hesperides from the tree. The dragon Ladon (not fully preserved), represented as a three-headed snake coiled around the trunk, defends the tree. To the far right as a figure to frame the figural scene, Atlas (partially preserved) stands frontally with right hand on his hip, probably holding the heavens on his shoulders.

B. Upper zone: Amazons preparing for battle. All the Amazons wear *chitoniskoi,* greaves, and corslets, and all except for two on the left wear helmets that are either of Attic or Chalcidian type. At left, five Amazons dressed in *chitoniskoi*, corselets, and greaves form two groups who test their weapons and begin to arm. The first Amazon testing her arrow serves as the framing device at the left end of the scene; she has a low-crested Chalcidian helmet on her head. Next to her, a companion facing left holds a Corinthian helmet, spear, and round shield (device: lion), and has her hair bound up in a *krobylos* with a fillet. The third Amazon also has her hair in a *krobylos* with a fillet around it; she tests her spear while her round shield and Corinthian helmet lie on the ground. Standing frontally while looking to her right, she is the transitional figure between the two pairs. The other two Amazons are arming. The fourth Amazon with a Chalcidian helmet on her head faces right (98.AE.82.3 provides a segment of her thighs and drapery), holding her round shield up before her (only the lower half depicted; device: legs of a running figure = *triskeles*) while the last, facing left, puts on her right greave and has an Attic helmet on her head (98.AE.82.6 preserves part of the helmet crest and saltire square on the rim). In the center, three Amazons fully armed with two spears, shields, and helmets on their heads (the two on the right have Chalcidian helmets, while the third at the rear has an Attic helmet) calmly lead their horses to right; the lead one has a *pelta*. Another group of three fully armed Amazons move quickly to the right of the scene. Two of them are on foot and one leads a horse, all running toward a trumpeter. The Amazon leading the horse wears an Attic helmet while the other two have Chalcidian helmets on their heads. The second Amazon carries a battle-axe in her right hand. The Amazon behind her holds a spear with her right hand and a round shield is on her left. The trumpeter blows a *salpinx*, in the shape of a long, narrow cylindrical tube terminating in a bell (*kodon*). She is a hoplite with greaves, has a Chalcidian helmet on her head and a round shield on her left arm, and she holds a spear in her left hand while facing left as the framing device at the right end of the scene.

Lower zone: Peleus seizing Thetis. At far left a woman, probably Doris dressed in chiton and himation with her hair in a *krobylos* and a fillet, stands facing right and extending her right arm. Two Nereids dressed in chitons and himatia flee left to her with both feet off the ground and looking back at the abduction. The first Nereid has her golden hair down, the other wears hers in a *krobylos* bound with a fillet. The second Nereid holds a small branch in her left hand. Cheiron with Peleus and Thetis (partially preserved) are placed in the center of the composition. The centaur looks on from the left side, dressed in himation and with a fillet around his head. He has human forelegs and carries a branch over his shoulder. Before him, Peleus wrestles with Thetis. The beardless hero’s hair is in a *krobylos* with a fillet tied around. A snake, one of Thetis’s metamorphoses, is coiled around his left leg. Thetis is in the grasp of Peleus. Part of her chiton is preserved with the lower part of her face looking left. Two Nereids dressed in chitons and himatia flee to Nereus on the right. The first (upper part of her head not preserved) runs with her feet off the ground as she looks back toward Thetis. She holds a fish in her left hand and pulls up on her garment with the right so that she can run faster. The second Nereid also runs with both feet off ground and extends her hands toward Nereus. Her hair is in a *krobylos*, and she wears a red fillet around her head. Nereus, the father of Thetis, is seated on a *thakos* (seat) to left. Depicted as an old man with rounded shoulders, he is dressed in chiton and himation, with a fillet around his head, and supports himself with a knobby staff with his right hand.

Spirals are a relatively unusual decorative motif on volutes of volute kraters. For other examples, see Athens, Agora P 24784 and P 26550 ({{< q-abbr "*Agora* 30" >}}, p. 173, nos. 242–43, pl. 33), and three vases by the Niobid Painter: Bologna, Museo Civico Archeologico 268 ({{< q-abbr "*ARV*<sup>2</sup>" >}} 598.1; {{< q-abbr "*Paralipomena*" >}} 394; {{< q-abbr "*Beazley Addenda*<sup>2</sup>" >}} 265; {{< q-abbr "Schleiffenbaum, *Volutenkrater*" >}}, pp. 332–33, no.

See comment on the handle ornament of the Getty krater by D. Williams, “Beyond the Berlin Painter: Toward a Workshop View,” in {{< q-abbr "Padgett and Guy, *Berlin Painter*" >}}, p. 176. The handles on Louvre G 166, a volute krater by the Berlin Painter, which are given as examples for spirals on the flange in {{< q-abbr "*Agora* 30" >}}, p. 173, no. 242, belong to our krater 77.AE.11, and they are currently incorporated into it. See Frel, {{< q-abbr "*GettyMusJ*" >}} 4 (1977): 75, note 7.

In overall shape and decoration, the krater resembles the black-figure volute-kraters of the late sixth century B.C., which have a black body, figural decoration on the neck and rays at the base. Cf. the black-figure krater by the Golvol Group in Boston, Museum of Fine Arts 90.153 ({{< q-abbr "*ABV*" >}} 194–95, 689; {{< q-abbr "*Paralipomena*" >}} 79–80; {{< q-abbr "*Beazley Addenda*<sup>2</sup>" >}} 52; {{< q-abbr "Hitzl, *Volutenkraters*" >}}, pp. 297–98, no. 34). See J. Neils, “The Euthymides Krater from Morgantina,” {{< q-abbr "*AJA*" >}} 99 (1995): 428–31.

For figural decoration on both registers of the neck, see {{< q-abbr "Hitzl, *Volutenkraters*" >}}, pp. 115–20; {{< q-abbr "Schleiffenbaum, *Volutenkrater*" >}}, pp. 57–60. The scheme is found mostly on black-figure volute-kraters. See {{< q-abbr "Hitzl, *Volutenkraters*" >}}, pp. 304–5, 317–24, 328–33, 340, 357, 365, 379, 382, 385, 398, 399, 419, 428, nos. 38, 45, 46, 47, 48, 51, 52, 53, 60, 76, 84, 99, 102, 105, 118, 119, 140, 151; {{< q-abbr "Schleiffenbaum, *Volutenkrater*" >}}, pp. 265, 270, 273, 275, 276, 279, 282, 285, 287, 293, 294, 306, 307, 308, 312–17, nos.

For red-figure examples, see a volute-krater by the Kleophrades Painter once in Freiburg, art market (*Kunst der Antike. Galerie Günter Puhze Friburg*, 1983, cat. no. 5, p. 21, no. 189); an unattributed neck fragment in Reggio Calabria, Museo Nazionale C 4006 ({{< q-abbr "Kunisch, “Zum helmhaltende Athena”" >}}, p. 92, no. 98, pl. 47); and a neck fragment near the Nikoxenos Painter in the Rhodes Museum without inv. no. ({{< q-abbr "*ARV*<sup>2</sup>" >}} 223.4; {{< q-abbr "Schleiffenbaum, *Volutenkrater*" >}}, p. 388, no. V335; G. Jacopi, *Esplorazione Archeologica di Camiro 2*, {{< q-abbr "*ClRh*" >}} 6/7 [Rhodes, 1932/39], p. 175, fig. 207). Herakles is a popular subject for decorating the necks of volute kraters; see {{< q-abbr "Hitzl, *Volutenkraters*" >}}, pp. 286–432; {{< q-abbr "Schleiffenbaum, *Volutenkrater*" >}}, pp. 257–404.

Close to the neck decoration of our vase is an unattributed black-figure volute-krater in Munich, Staatliche Antikensammlungen 1740 ({{< q-abbr "Hitzl, *Volutenkraters*" >}}, pp. 119, 125–26, 304–5, cat. no. 38, pls. 48–49a; {{< q-abbr "Schleiffenbaum, *Volutenkrater*" >}}, p. 286, no. V106). The painter of this vase also has placed the figural decoration again in two registers on the neck, leaving the body black, except for the zone with the black rays at the bottom of the body. Worthy of note is that the scenes with the abduction of Thetis by Peleus in the presence of Cheiron, and the arming of the Amazons, are found on both vases and in the same registers.

The Kleophrades Painter divides all the scenes on the krater into triptychs primarily using the “back to back” scheme. This seems to be characteristic of the painter; cf. a volute krater in Freiburg, art market (*Kunst der Antike. Galerie Günter Puhze Freiburg*, 1983, cat. no. 5, p. 21, no. 189). Despite the limitations of the space given on a vase, he maintained his preference for narration. The miniaturist execution of the figures is of high quality and very carefully done. Except for the missing parts of the Amazonomachy on A, which does not allow for a full reconstruction, the rest of the scenes can be easily restored.

Frontal figures such as Atlas are a common feature in the work of the Kleophrades Painter: cf. a pointed amphora in Munich, Staatliche Antikensammlungen NI 8732 ({{< q-abbr "*ARV*<sup>2</sup>" >}} 182.6; M. Tiverios, *Archaia Aggeia* [Athens, 1996], pp. 134–35, 296, figs. 106–7); a hydria in Museo Archeologico Provinciale di Salerno 1371 ({{< q-abbr "*ARV*<sup>2</sup>" >}} 188.67; J. Boardman, in {{< q-abbr "*LIMC*" >}}, vol. 5 [1990], pt. 1, p. 156, no. 3233); and a skyphos in Florence, Museo Archeologico 4218 ({{< q-abbr "*ARV*<sup>2</sup>" >}} 191.102; S. Colvin, “On Representations of Centaurs in Greek Vase-Painting,” {{< q-abbr "*JHS*" >}} 1 [1880]: 139–47, pl. 3).

The Amazonomachy was a popular subject in Greek art during the Archaic and Classical periods. For Amazonomachies with Herakles, see D. von Bothmer, *Amazons in Greek Art* (Oxford, 1957), pp. 6–10, 30–63, 111–12, 115, 117, 120; M. Schmidt, “Zu Amazonomachiedarstellungen der Berliner Malers und des Euphronios,” in *Tainia. Festschrift für Roland Hampe*, ed. H. A Cahn, and E. Simon (Mainz am Rhein, 1980), pp. 153–69; A. Kauffmann-Samaras, in {{< q-abbr "*LIMC*" >}}, vol. 1 (1981), pt. 1, pp. 587–97, s.v. “Amazones”; J. Boardman, “Herakles, Theseus and Amazons,” in *The Eye of Greece: Studies in the Art of Athens*, eds. D. Kurtz and B. Sparkes (Cambridge, 1982), pp. 1–28; W. Blake Tyrrel, *Amazons: A Study in Athenian Mythmaking* (Baltimore, 1984); {{< q-abbr "Brommer, “Herakles und Theseus”" >}}, pp. 183–89; {{< q-abbr "Schefold and Jung, *Die Urkönige Perseus*" >}}, pp. 154–60; J. Henderson, “Timeo Danaos: Amazons in Early Greek Art and Pottery,” in *Art and Text in Ancient Greek Culture*, ed. S. Goldhill and R. Osborne (Cambridge, 1994), 85–137; D. Saunders, “An Amazonomachy Attributed to the Syleus Painter,” in {{< q-abbr "*Athenian Potters and Painters*" >}}, vol. 3, 187–96. Cf. the cup by the Kleophrades Painter in Paris, {{< q-abbr "Cab. Méd." >}} 535 ({{< q-abbr "*ARV*<sup>2</sup>" >}} 191.103; Beazley, *Kleophrades Painter*, pp. 9–10, pls. 11–12), for a similar arrangement (note the use again of a Centaur as the shield device for the Amazon attacking Herakles) and the presence of both heroes in the scene. For other examples following the pattern of the same two heroes (Herakles and Telamonian Ajax) fighting back to back against the Amazons, cf. the volute-krater by Euphronios in Arezzo, Museo Archeologico Mecenate 1465 ({{< q-abbr "*ARV*<sup>2</sup>" >}} 15.6; Bothmer, *Amazons* [supra], pl. 69.3); the volute krater by Euthymides from Morgantina, Aidone, Museo Archeologico 58.2382 ({{< q-abbr "*ARV*<sup>2</sup>" >}} 128.10, 1620; {{< q-abbr "*Beazley Addenda*<sup>2</sup>" >}} 156; J. Neils, “The Euthymides Krater from Morgantina,” {{< q-abbr "*AJA*" >}} 99 [1995]: 427–44); a kantharos by Douris in Brussels, Musées Royaux d’Art et d’Histoire A 718 ({{< q-abbr "*ARV*<sup>2</sup>" >}} 445.256; 1653; {{< q-abbr "*Paralipomena*" >}} 521; {{< q-abbr "*Beazley Addenda*<sup>2</sup>" >}} 241; {{< q-abbr "*CVA*" >}} 1 [Belgium 1], pls. 5–6). Cf. the comments by E. Reeder, in {{< q-abbr "*Pandora*" >}}, p. 375 and C. Benson, in {{< q-abbr "*Pandora*" >}}, p. 376.

While all the Amazons use spears, Herakles uses a sword. Worthy of note is that Ajax holds a *machaira*, a type of single-edged sword with a distinctive hook-like pommel that is designed for slashing rather than for stabbing. For the *machaira*, see A. Snodgrass, *Arms and Armour of the Greeks* (London, 1967), p. 97; F. Sanz, *Archivo Espaňol de Arqueología* 63 (1990): 65–93; J. K. Anderson, “Hoplite Weapons and Offensive Arms,” in *Hoplites: The Classical Greek Battle Experience*, ed. V. Hanson (London, 1991), pp. 26, 32; P. Bonnechere, “La μάχαιρα était dissimulée dans le κανοữν: quelques interrogations,” {{< q-abbr "*REA*" >}} 101 (1999): 21–35; T. H. Carpenter, “Harmodios and Apollo in Fifth-Century Athens: What’s in a Pose?,” in {{< q-abbr "*Athenian Potters and Painters*" >}}, vol. 1, pp. 172–74, where *machaira* is considered as a “barbaric” weapon. In this case, it is strange that Ajax holds the *machaira* and not an Amazon. Carpenter, supra, p. 178, note 16, mentions also that the Kleophrades Painter is the earliest known to include the appropriate scabbard for the *machaira*. For the use of a *machaira* in the Amazonomachy, see P. Devambez, in {{< q-abbr "*LIMC*" >}}, vol. 1 (1981), pt. 1, pp. 586–653, s.v. “Amazones.” The *machaira* is also found in the Gigantomachy; cf. stamnos by the Tyszkiewicz Painter in London E 443 ({{< q-abbr "*ARV*<sup>2</sup>" >}} 292.29; {{< q-abbr "*CVA*" >}} British Museum 3 [Great Britain 4], pl. 21.3).

The preparation for battle of the Amazons on side B could be recognized as the scene before the battle depicted on A. This is also supported by the *salpinx* which was blown before or after the battle.

For the *salpinx*, see S. Michailidis, *Engiklopaedeia tis archaeas ellinikis mousikis* (Athens, 1982), pp. 278–79; M. Tiverios, *Perikleia Panathenaia.

Manakidou (Thessaloniki, 2014), pp. 257–70.

The *salpinx* is mainly a warlike instrument with a military use, for example, to signal the beginning of the battle, which in our case is depicted on the other side of the krater. Moreover, the *salpinx* gave cavalry signals (Xenophon, *Hipparch.* 3.12), something that also coincides with the depicted scene. In Attic vase-painting it is found mostly in battle scenes and less often in Dionysiac contexts, rituals, and athletics (see Neils, “Bronze-belled Braying” [supra], pp. 258–66). Trumpeting Amazons are found in Late Archaic Athenian iconography; cf. a red-figure hydria by Hypsis in Munich, Staatliche Antikensammlungen 2423 ({{< q-abbr "*ARV*<sup>2</sup>" >}} 30.1; {{< q-abbr "*Beazley Addenda*<sup>2</sup>" >}} 156; {{< q-abbr "Bundrick, *Music and Image*" >}}, p. 46, fig. 29); a red-figure cup by Oltos in Vatican AST 47 ({{< q-abbr "*ARV*<sup>2</sup>" >}} 47.152; {{< q-abbr "*Beazley Addenda*<sup>2</sup>" >}} 78; B.

It is worth noting that the vase-painter has depicted the labors in the order in which they supposedly took place.

Pausanias (2.37.4) claims that Peisandros invented the idea of a Hydra with many heads to make his account more impressive. A scholion to the *Theogony* adds that Alkaios (443 frg.) gave her nine heads (see fragments of Sappho and Alkaios cited according to E. Lobel and D. L. Page, *Poetarum lesbiorum fragmenta* [Oxford, 1955]). The nine-headed Hydra is found in several literary sources (Apollodorus, *Bibliotheca* 2.5.2; Hyginus, Fabulae 151; Suda, s.v. “Hydra”) and is common on the representations throughout the fifth century B.C. During this period the Hydra is normally shown with nine or seven heads, with some exceptions that vary from three to eleven heads (see G. Kokkorou-Alewras, in {{< q-abbr "*LIMC*" >}}, vol. 5 [1990], pt. 1, pp. 42–43, s.v. “Herakles and the Lernean Hydra”). For the chronological appearance of literary sources regarding the myth, see T. Gantz, *Early Greek Myth: A Guide to Literary and Artistic Sources* (Baltimore and London, 1993), pp. 384–86. For Herakles’s labor with the Hydra, see also {{< q-abbr "*CVA*" >}} Basel 1 (Switzerland 4), pp. 41–43, pl. 11.10–13; P. Amandry and D. Amyx, “Héraclès et l’hydre de Lerne dans la céramique corinthienne,” {{< q-abbr "*AK*" >}} 25 (1982): 102–16; J. J. Maffre, “Le combat d’Héraclès contre l’hydre de Lerne dans la collection de vases grecs du Louvre,” *Revue du Louvre et des musées de France* 35 (1985): pp. 83–95; {{< q-abbr "Brommer, *Heracles*" >}}, pp. 12–18. Athena standing behind Herakles while he fights with the Hydra is not rare in Attic vase-painting; cf. a cup by the Ashby Painter in Athens, Agora P 7899 ({{< q-abbr "*ARV*<sup>2</sup>" >}} 455.12; {{< q-abbr "*Agora* 30" >}}, p. 309, no. 1340, pl. 125); an oinochoe in Hermitage B 4257 ({{< q-abbr "Brommer, *Heracles*" >}}, pl. 14). The placement of Herakles to the left of the Hydra with Iolaos to the right is typical. Iolaos is shown as a hoplite in Archaic black-figure vase-painting: cf. a Tyrrhenian amphora by the Castellani Painter, once on the Roman market ({{< q-abbr "*ABV*" >}} 97.25; {{< q-abbr "*Paralipomena*" >}} 35.37; J. Kluiver, “The Five Later ‘Tyrrhenian’ Painters,” {{< q-abbr "*BABesch*" >}} 71 [1996]: 9, no. 181); a white ground lekythos in the manner of the Theseus Painter, in Agrigento, Museo Archeologico Regionale C869 ({{< q-abbr "*ABV*" >}} 521; C. H. E. Haspels, *Attic Black-Figured Lekythoi* (Paris, 1936), 254.2; {{< q-abbr "*CVA*" >}}, Agrigento 1 [Italy 31], pls. 75.1–2, 76.1–2); a neck amphora by the Diosphos Painter in Paris, Louvre F 387 (Haspels, *Attic Black-Figured Lekythoi*, 238.132; F. Lissarrague, *Greek Vases: The Athenians and heir Images* [Riverside, 2001], p. 166, fig. 126); and red-figure vase-painting: cf. an amphora by the Kleophrades Painter in Cologny, Fond. M. Bodmer (Maffre, “Le combat d’Héraclès contre l’hydre de Lerne” [supra], p. 89, fig. 10); a stamnos by the Syleus Painter in Palermo, Museo Nazionale V 763 (275) ({{< q-abbr "*ARV*<sup>2</sup>" >}} 251.34; {{< q-abbr "*CVA*" >}}, Palermo 1 [Italy 50], pl. 31.4); and perhaps on a fragmentary cup by the Ashby Painter in Athens, Agora P 7899; {{< q-abbr "*ARV*<sup>2</sup>" >}} 455.12; {{< q-abbr "*Agora* 30" >}}, p. 309, no. 1340, pl. 125].

The labor with Geryon is more popular in black-figure than on red-figure vases. For the setting, cf. a red-figure cup by Euphronios in Munich, Staatliche Antikensammlungen 8704 ({{< q-abbr "*ARV*<sup>2</sup>" >}} 16–17.17; 1619; {{< q-abbr "*Paralipomena*" >}} 322; {{< q-abbr "*Beazley Addenda*<sup>2</sup>" >}}153; F. W. Hamdorf, in {{< q-abbr "*Euphronios der Maler*" >}}, pp. 199–204, cat. no. 41), depicting the scene with the involvement of the same figures (Herakles, Geryon, Orthros, Eurytion). The version of Eurytion being killed while asleep is rare (cf. the representations in E. Zervoudaki, in {{< q-abbr "*LIMC*" >}}, vol. 4 [1988], pt. 1, pp. 112–17, s.v. “Eurytion II”); perhaps this is an innovation of the Kleophrades Painter.

Except for the number of the heads, Ladon is depicted almost like the Hydra. Normally Ladon has one head; three heads are very rare. For another example, cf. a hydria in {{< q-abbr "Cab. Méd." >}} 4820 (J. D. Beazley, *Attische Vasenmaler des rotfigurigen Stils* [Tűbingen, 1925], p. 320, no. 17 [attributed to the Amymone Painter]). Cf. also a neck amphora attributed to the manner of Euphronios in Hermitage B 2351 (A. Bukina, A. Petrakova, and C. Phillips, *Greek Vases in the Imperial Hermitage Museum: The History of the Collection 1816–69, with Addenda et Corrigenda to Ludolf Stephani, Die Vasen-Sammlung der Kaiserlichen Ermitage (1869)* (Oxford, 2013), p. 156, fig. 103. The image of Herakles picking the apples on his own is not common in Attic red-figure; for other examples, see G. Kokkorou-Alewras, in {{< q-abbr "*LIMC*" >}}, vol. 5 (1990), pt. 1, pp. 102–3, s.v. “Herakles and the Hesperides.”

Pegasos is a trademark on the Kleophrades Painter’s shields, particularly on the Panathenaic amphorae. See Frel, {{< q-abbr "*GettyMusJ*" >}} 4 (1977): 70; Matheson, “Panathenaic Amphorae by the Kleophrades Painter” (supra), pp. 95, 100; Kunze-Götte, *Der Kleophrades-Maler* (supra), p. 19; M. Bentz, *Panathenäische Preisamphoren. Eine athenische Vasengattung und ihre Funktion vom 6.–4. Jahrhundert v. Chr*. (Basel, 1998), pp. 48–49.

For Atlas supporting the heavens, cf. a cup by Makron in Bochum, Ruhr-Universität S 1168 (N. Kunisch, *Erläuterung zur Griechischen Vasenmalerei* [Bochum, 1996], pp. 161–65); Mommsen, “Prometheus oder Atlas?” (supra).

For Athena and Herakles, see N. Kunisch, “Athena und Herakles. Entwicklung bildlicher Mythen im 5. Jahrhundert v. Chr.,” in *Mythos. Erzählende Weltdeutung im Spannungsfeld von Ritual, Geschichte und Rationalität* (Trier, 1990), 75–89.

For the seated Athena, see {{< q-abbr "Kunisch, “Zum helmhaltende Athena”" >}}, 85–104, esp. p. 92, nos. 96–108. On the neck fragment in Reggio Calabria, Museo Nazionale C 4006 ({{< q-abbr "Kunisch, “Zum helmhaltende Athena”" >}}, pl. 47a), the seated goddess watches the hero wrestling; the subject might be Herakles with the Nemean Lion or the Marathonian Bull. For Athena’s types, see P. Demargne, in {{< q-abbr "*LIMC*" >}}*,* vol. 2 (1984), pt. 1, pp. 955–1044, s.v. “Athena”; B. Sismondo Ridgway, “Images of Athena on the Akropolis,” {{< q-abbr "*Goddess and Polis*" >}}, pp. 119–42.

The wrestling of Peleus and Thetis is also found on other vases attributed to the Kleophrades Painter. Cf. the fragmentary red-figure stamnos in Malibu, J. Paul Getty Museum [81.AE.220](http://www.getty.edu/art/collection/objects/10094/) ({{< q-abbr "Barringer, *Divine Escorts*" >}}, pl. 100); an amphora of type A in a private collection attributed to the painter by J.-L. Zimmermann (J.-L. Zimmermann, in *Art Antique: Collections privées de Suisse Romande*, ed. J. Dörig [Geneva, 1975], no. 204); for an attribution of the vase to the Dikaios Painter by D. von Bothmer, see D. von Bothmer, *Glories of the Past: Ancient Art from the Shelby White and Leon Levy Collection* (New York, 1990), pp. 153–54, no. 115. The depiction of the theme on a volute-krater is extremely rare in Attic vase-painting (for another example, see the black-figure volute-krater in Munich, Staatliche Antikensammlungen 1740, mentioned above); cf. R. Vollkommer, in {{< q-abbr "*LIMC*" >}}, vol. 7 (1994), pt. 1, pp. 255–69, s.v. “Peleus.” For Kleophrades Painter and the subject, see J. Boardman, “The Kleophrades Painter at Troy,” {{< q-abbr "*AK*" >}} 19 (1976): 3–4.

For Peleus and Thetis, see J. Kaiser, *Peleus und Thetis: eine sagengeschichtliche Untersuchung* (Munich, 1912); Krieger, “Der Kampf zwischen Peleus und Thetis” (supra); {{< q-abbr "Barringer, *Divine Escorts*" >}}, pp. 69–77; C. Sourvinou-Inwood, “A Series of Erotic Pursuits: Images and Meanings,” {{< q-abbr "*JHS*" >}} 107 (1987): 138–39; E. Reeder, “Peleus and Thetis,” in {{< q-abbr "*Pandora*" >}}, pp. 340–51; R.

Vollkommer, in {{< q-abbr "*LIMC*" >}}*,* vol. 8 (1997), pt. 1, pp. 6–9, s.v. “Thetis.” For pursuit scenes, see also [entry no. 4](/catalogue/4/) (86.AE.207). The scene belongs to Krieger’s “Umklammerungstypus” (the struggle type), which dominates the extant Attic representations of the subject. Cf. also two other vases by the Kleophrades Painter depicting the subject: a fragmentary red-figure stamnos in the Getty Museum [81.AE.220](http://www.getty.edu/art/collection/objects/10094/) ({{< q-abbr "Barringer, *Divine Escorts*" >}}, pl. 100) and a cup in the British Museum E 73 ({{< q-abbr "*ARV*<sup>2</sup>" >}} 192.106; {{< q-abbr "Barringer, *Divine Escorts*" >}}, p. 194, no. 132).

The symmetrical arrangement with three figures on each end of the scene moving away from the central group highlights the setting with the struggling couple and Cheiron. The composition with the two protagonists struggling in the center and flanked by Cheiron to the left and a fleeing Nereid to right is found on a black-figure belly-amphora in Munich 1415.WAF Near the Leagros Group ({{< q-abbr "Barringer, *Divine Escorts*" >}}, pl. 71). The centaur is again depicted with human forelegs and holds a branch over his shoulder. The similarity extends to the Nereid who is fleeing to the right looking back toward Thetis and holding her garment with her right hand. This arrangement with Cheiron standing next to the couple is found primarily in black-figure, whereas in red-figure he is usually placed further away (for another exception, see a hydria in *Münzen und Medaillen Sonderliste* N [Basel, 1971]: 15, no. 10). For Attic vases depicting Cheiron in the scene, see R. Vollkommer, in {{< q-abbr "*LIMC*" >}}, vol. 7 (1994), pt. 1, pp. 256, 261–63, s.v. “Peleus”; M. Gisler-Huwiler, in {{< q-abbr "*LIMC*" >}}, vol. 3 (1986), pt. 1, pp. 239–40, s.v. “Cheiron.” For Cheiron, see also M. Vogel, *Chiron der Kentaur mit der Kithara* (Bonn, 1978).

Centaurs from Geometric and Archaic times are normally depicted as ordinary men with human feet and the rear end of a horse grafted on. For centaurs with human forelegs, see B. Schiffer, *Die Typologie der Kentauren in der antiken Kunst* (Frankfurt am Main, 1976), pp. 30–37, 257–61, nos. A/Ch1-41; J. M. Padgett, “Horse Men: Centaurs and Satyrs in Early Greek Art,” in {{< q-abbr "Padgett, *The Centaur’s Smile*" >}}, pp. 3–46, with previous bibliography. For centaurs, see also S. Colvin, “On Representations of Centaurs in Greek Vase-Painting,” {{< q-abbr "*JHS*" >}} 1 (1880): 107–67; P. V. C. Baur, *Centaurs in Ancient Art* (Berlin, 1912); E.

## Comparanda

The proportions of the figures and the size of the fragment indicate that it comes from a krater as large as [entry no. 19](/catalogue/19/) (77.AE.11). The execution of the design is very carefully done, similar to [entry no. 19](/catalogue/19/). Cf. the drapery with that on the fragment 86.AE.587 of [entry no. 19](/catalogue/19/); the facial features recall those of the Amazons on the fragment 97.AE.58.2 of the same krater.

The preserved elements of the lost figural scene indicate that the subject depicted is the Ilioupersis. Cf. the Onesimos cup in Rome, Villa Giulia (once in J. Paul Getty Museum 83.AE.362, 84.AE.80, 86.AE.385; D. Williams, “Onesimos and the Getty Iliupersis,” {{< q-abbr "*Greek Vases in the Getty* 5" >}}, pp. 41–64; {{< q-abbr "Mangold, *Kassandra in Athen*" >}}, pp. 47, 161, no.

Gasparri, in {{< q-abbr "*LIMC*" >}}, vol. 3 (1986), pt. 1, pp. 456–57, s.v. “Dionysos.” The scene is not very common, and the identification of the youth is problematic. A suggestion that he is Oinopion, son of Dionysos, is possible, especially because of his appearance in symposion scenes with Dionysos. Cf. also the poros pediment from Corfu, in {{< q-abbr "*LIMC*" >}}, vol. 3 (1986), pt. 1, p. 456, no. 370, s.v. “Dionysos,” depicting Dionysos reclining with a youth, maybe Oinopion.

PROVENANCE

–1979, George R. Stevenson (Glendale, California); 1979, donated to the J. Paul Getty Museum; Museum documentation for 1979 records that this vase “was in Mr. Stevenson’s possession for more than five years”; another note gives “Ex Summa Galleries”; this information has not been verified.

## Shape and Ornament

Fragments preserving most of the rim and neck, as well as a small section of the upper body. Flaring rim flat and black on the top. Offset at the top of figured frieze and another at the top of the lotus and palmette frieze; a groove at the junction of the neck with the body. Interior black to the base of the neck with a reserved band under the shoulder and thinner, irregular black inside the body. Ionic *kymation* on the outside edge of rim. Convex zone below it with ivy and berry pattern. Narrow flat zone with Ionic *kymation* between the rim and the neck. Upper zone of neck decorated with alternating budding lotuses and encircled palmettes. Black tongue pattern beneath the junction of neck with the body; all the patterns are interrupted at the handles. Traces of an inverted palmette beneath the one preserved stump of a handle.

## Subject

Neck. A.–B. Thiasos with six satyrs and five maenads runs around the neck interrupted by the handles. On A, three pairs of satyrs and maenads. The maenad on the left is dressed in chiton and himation, and moves to left looking back at a satyr. A feline is perched on her extended left arm and hand. The nude satyr who pursues her carries a full wineskin over his shoulder and a forked stick in his right hand. Behind him, a maenad dressed in a belted peplos chases a satyr to the right. She holds a forked stick horizontally in her right hand, and a leopard skin is draped over her extended left arm and pinned at her right shoulder. Before her a nude satyr, in three- quarter back view, looks back while moving to the right holding out a wineskin in his right hand. A fillet hangs above in the background. The third pair consists of a maenad, dressed in a belted peplos, who moves to the right toward a satyr who bends over to right with a leopard skin draped across his back. A kantharos hangs suspended in the field above him. The maenad has tear-drop earrings and swings a thyrsos at the satyr who scampers off on all fours. Like her counterpart in the central pair, she has a leopard skin draped over her extended left arm. Each maenad has her hair tied up in a *krobylos*. There are no real framing figures on this side, giving the impression that the scene continues on side B.

B. Three satyrs with two maenads between them. Two satyrs at the two ends may serve as framing figures indicating the ends of the scene. On the left, a nude satyr (face missing) moves to the right with a torch in his left hand facing right. A maenad before him runs to the right wearing a chiton and carrying a thyrsos(?) (upper end not preserved) over her left shoulder. She has thrown her head back in song or ecstasy. The satyr in the middle, facing left, approaches a pointed amphora lying before him. Behind him another maenad runs to left, looking back at the satyr who pursues her. She is dressed in a peplos and carries a lighted torch in each hand. Her hair is tied up in a *krobylos* and is decorated with a diadem. At the right end of the scene stands a thyrsos with a kantharos suspended above it.

Body. A. Ilioupersis. Ajax and Kassandra. Only the upper parts of the figures are preserved. The Palladion, dressed in a peplos and armed with an Attic helmet, spear, and a shield, stands frontally in the center of the scene. Athena (only her head is preserved) stands to the right of the statue facing left and wearing an Attic helmet. Kassandra (only her head is preserved), wearing a dotted band with three upright leaves around her head, sits or kneels at the feet of the statue. Ajax (upper part of his body and head are preserved but his face is missing) reaches for Kassandra with his right hand. He is bearded, wears a low-crested Corinthian helmet pushed back on his head, and has a himation slung over his right shoulder. The round shield on his left arm is shown in a three-quarter view from the inside, and is decorated with a four-pointed star. Behind him on the left, a female attendant or priestess (upper part of the body and head preserved) stands to the right. Dressed in a chiton and wearing a disk earring, she has her hair tied up in a *krobylos* and carries on her head a chest decorated with a red rosette and tendrils.

AIAS (retrograde) is written to the right of his helmet.

KA[SSANΔΡΑ] is written starting at the right of Ajax’s helmet and continuing above Kassandra.

AΘΕΝΑ is between the heads of the two Athenas.

The presence of MENE [LAOS] is indicated by an inscription behind Athena’s head.

A group of three letters on the neck (E the last at right), near wreath between satyr and maenad on the neck.

## Attribution and Date

Attributed to Polygnotos by J. R. Guy. Circa 440–435 B.C.

## Dimensions and Condition

Height 28.8 cm; height of figural scene on neck 9 cm; diam. of rim 47.7 cm (outside); diam of rim 39 cm (inside); thickness (body wall) 1.1 cm. Mended from fragments. Rim worn and abraded in various places. Misfired at the right end of side A.

## Technical Features

Preliminary sketch. Relief contour. Accessory color. Red: vine and berry clusters in ivy wreath, flame of maenad’s torches on side B, leaves on Kassandra’s headband, inscriptions. White: wreaths on satyrs, rosettes on box. Dilute black: interior details of torches, thyrsi, border of himation, spots on leopard skin, pattern (wreath?) on fallen amphora, hair of Palladion, details on the helmet of Athena, anatomical details, and helmet of Ajax. Hair of Athena is rendered by relief dots on black background.

The scene of Ajax dragging Kassandra from Athena’s statue at the sack of Troy appeared in Attic vase-painting during the second quarter of the sixth century B.C. and became popular around the time of the Ionian Revolt and the Persian Wars. The placement of Kassandra in the middle of the scene, between Athena and Ajax, is typical, especially for the late Archaic period; cf. the Oltos cup in Malibu, J. Paul Getty Museum [80.AE.154](http://www.getty.edu/art/collection/objects/9354/) ({{< q-abbr "*BAPD*" >}} 16776; {{< q-abbr "Tzachou-Alexandri, “Κασσάνδραν”" >}}, p. 296); a hydria (Vivenzio) by the Kleophrades Painter in Naples, Museo Archeologico Nazionale 81669 ({{< q-abbr "*ARV*<sup>2</sup>" >}} 189.74; {{< q-abbr "*Paralipomena*" >}} 341; {{< q-abbr "*Beazley Addenda*<sup>2</sup>" >}} 189; {{< q-abbr "*BAPD*" >}} 201724; {{< q-abbr "Mangold, *Kassandra in Athen*" >}}, fig. 64).

For Kassandra and Ajax in wall-painting, see *La Tomba François di Vulci*, ed. F. Buranelli (Rome, 1987), p. 102, fig. 15, where the traditional statue of Athena has been replaced by an image of Aphrodite.

The available space indicates a symmetrical arrangement with three figures on each side of the Palladion. The inscription MENE[. . .] suggests that Menelaos and Helen completed the scene behind Athena. Both couples are found on an Apulian krater by the Ilioupersis Painter in the British Museum F 160 (A. D. Trendall and A. Cambitoglou, *The Red-figured Vases of Apulia* I [Oxford, 1978], p. 193.8; O. Touchefeu, in {{< q-abbr "*LIMC*" >}}, vol. 1 [1981], pt. 1, pp. 343–44, no. 59, s.v. “Aias II”).

For the identification of the fleeing female as a priestess, see T. B. L. Webster, *Monuments Illustrating Tragedy and Satyr Play<sup>2</sup>* (London, 1967), pp. 146–47. For an identification as a servant, see {{< q-abbr "Moret, *Ilioupersis*" >}}, pp. 22–23. For priestesses and priests in Greek art and the problems of their iconography, see J. B.

Pirenne-Delforge, in *Thesaurus Cultus et Rituum Antiquorum*, vol. 5 (Los Angeles, 2005), pp. 3–31, s.v. “Prêtres et prêtresses”; A. G. Mantis, “Provlimata tis ikonografias ton Iereion kai ton Iereon stin archaia elliniki techni” (Ph.D. diss., University of Thessaloniki, 1983); Mantis (pp. 24–28, 76) does not recognize as priestesses the women with sacrificial baskets or boxes and suggests that they are simply *kanephoroi* or maids. The mythical priestess of Athena in Troy is known as Theano, and she appears in several representations. For depictions of Theano, see Mantis (supra), pp. 72–80; {{< q-abbr "Moret, *Ilioupersis*" >}}, Index, s.v. “Théano”; A. Lezzi-Hafter, in {{< q-abbr "*LIMC*" >}}, vol. 7 ([1994], pt. 1, pp. 911–13, s.v. “Theano I.” For her presence at the rape of Kassandra, cf. another volute krater by the Group of Polygnotos in Taranto, Museo Nazionale T 11 (A. Lezzi-Hafter, in {{< q-abbr "*LIMC*" >}}, vol. 7 (1994), pt. 1, p. 912, no. 7, s.v. “Theano I”) in which Theano (inscribed) clutches the statue of Athena while sitting at its feet at the left part of the scene; kalpis by Polygnotos in Athens, National Museum 30116 ({{< q-abbr "Tzachou-Alexandri, “Κασσάνδραν”" >}}, pp. 289–302). The motif of the female fleeing to left and looking back with an object on her head at the left side of the scene seems to be typical of the Polygnotan Group for the subject. In addition to the Getty krater, it is found on the krater in Taranto (the woman is depicted behind Theano) and on the neck-amphora in Cambridge, Fitzwilliam Museum, Lewis Loan 103.22 (supra), where the woman has a footstool over her head.

The Palladion holds a principal role in the representation of the scene; cf. O. Touchefeu, in {{< q-abbr "*LIMC*" >}}, vol. 1 (1981), pt. 1, pp. 336–51, s.v. “Aias II”; {{< q-abbr "Mangold, *Kassandra in Athen*" >}}, 34–62. As a rule, it is depicted in the episode, and it is also mentioned by the literary sources (cf. Stefos, *O mythos tis Kassandras* [supra]). For the Palladion, see K. Schauenburg, “Statuen auf Vasenbildern,” {{< q-abbr "*JdI*" >}} 52 (1937): 30–75; E.

Raised dots indicating curly hair is a technique found on a number of high-quality vases from the Late Archaic period and found often on Euphronios’s works; see, for example, Athena on a calyx-krater once in New York, Collection of Leon Levy and Shelby White ({{< q-abbr "*Euphronios der Maler*" >}}, pp. 106–13, no. 6); Athena on a fragment of a calyx-krater in Malibu, J.

## Provenance

By 1986–87, Antike Kunst Palladion (Basel, Switzerland); 1987, sold to the J. Paul Getty Museum; Museum documentation records that the vase is “ex Swiss Private collection”; this information has not been verified.

## Shape and Ornament

Top of rim is black. Outside of rim on A and B decorated with Ionic *kymation* above a double palmette and lotus chain with relief dots in the palmette hearts and between the spiraling tendrils on A; on B larger upright palmette and lotus chain. An astragalos in relief runs along the molding between the rim and neck on both sides. A “rope” pattern runs around neck and body on both sides.

Upper neck. Zone of ivy vine in relief on A; myrtle wreath with berries between each pair of leaves on B.

Handles rise from the heads of four African men placed on the shoulder. Curling S-shaped scrolls with buds or leaves attached bridge the handles with the neck. Upper terminals of the volutes masked with concave disks decorated with gilded frontal female heads in relief in the center; around the heads, a frame is formed by five encircled palmettes each rendered with a raised heart. The roundels of the volutes of the handles are ringed by red chains of myrtle leaves with berries between each pair of leaves. The same leaf chain runs along the outer flanges of handles. A reserved strip along handles is visible on sides of the handles.

The body, squat and round like a dinos, is black, and decorated with vertical ribbing with even arches at the top. A smooth band above the widest circumference interrupts the ribbing and is decorated with a wreath of olive leaves and fruits interspersed, rendered in clay relief; the ends of the wreath are twisted together in the center of side A, just below the principal figure scene. The ribbing at the body ends shortly above the base, below which is a notched ridge. The walls of the vase draw to a projecting ring instead of a foot that was used to place the vessel securely upon its separate stand. The stand should originally have had a stem with an upper resting surface (now a modern reconstruction) for the the rounded bottom of the vase. The stand is divided into two parts. The upper part is decorated with a short Ionic *kymation* set between notched ridges. The figural scene is set between an Ionic *kymation* and a palmette and lotus chain; a notched ridge divides the two parts. A broad zone with long black-glaze tongues runs around the lower part of the stand. Ionic *kymation*; notched edge. Resting surface and underside stand reserved.

{ figure profile-24 a, b and c }

## Subject

Neck. A. Adonis and Aphrodite. The hero reclines facing left on a *kline* covered with a fringed and elaborately embroidered blanket at the center of the scene. He is propped up on cushions, a richly patterned himation draped over his lower body and legs; his upper body, nude, plump, and soft-looking, is missing the head, but his long hair can be seen in the curls running down over the left shoulder and breast; both his hands are raised to bind a fillet around his head. Eros crouches on the left end of the *kline*, and offers Adonis some round objects rendered in relief (fruits?) with his right hand; he holds a plate in his left with similar objects (two on each side of the plate are rendered in relief, four in the middle as white dots). Eros is nude with long curly hair and a fillet around his head. A low table or footstool with two round objects (fruits?) lies in front of the *kline*. At the left end of the scene, Aphrodite sits on a chest by the feet of Adonis, as two women (attendants?) stand behind her. The goddess, presented in three-quarter view, is dressed in a finely pleated diaphanous chiton that slips off her left shoulder and an elaborately patterned himation that is wrapped around her legs. Her hair is pulled back in a chignon, and she wears bracelets and a necklace. She looks back to the standing women, which, combined with the gesture of her left hand, suggests that she is engaged in conversation. The woman directly behind the goddess raises her hands toward Aphrodite. She is dressed in a finely pleated diaphanous chiton with a plain himation pulled up over her head. Like the goddess, she has her hair pulled back in a chignon, and she wears a bracelet, earrings, and necklace, as well as a diadem adorned with leaves on her head. A third woman stands at the left end of the scene facing right. She is dressed in a chiton similar to the other two, with a plain mantle wrapped around her left arm and lower body. Her left foot rests atop a chest, and she looks in a mirror that she holds in her left hand; in her raised right hand she holds a string of beads with which she prepares to adorn herself.

Another trio of women flanks the right side of Adonis’s bed. A second goddess, most likely Persephone, is seated on a chest flanked by her companions. She wears a finely pleated diaphanous chiton, which slips off her right shoulder, and an elaborately decorated himation around her legs. Persephone gestures with the mirror that she holds up in her right hand and faces left. She wears bracelets and earrings. Behind her, a companion stands facing left and leaning with her right arm on Persephone’s shoulder. She, too, is dressed in a finely pleated diaphanous chiton, which slips off her right shoulder, but she has a plain himation. Her hair is tied back with a band, and she wears a bracelet, necklace, and earrings. In front of Persephone, a woman dances. She wears a chiton similar to the others, necklace, earrings, and diadem, and a long, richly patterned himation covers most of her body and the back of her head. Her hands appear to rest on her waist, and her head is presented in a three-quarter view as she looks back at Persephone.

B. Symposion. Three pairs of banqueters recline on three *klinai*. Each pair consists of a young, beardless man and an older, bearded one engaged in conversation. All six figures are rendered in similar poses, with their left elbows propped at the same angle on a cushion and their legs to the left. All the youths, the left figure in each pair, turn their heads to the right to look at their older partner. All the figures are partially nude, with their upper bodies exposed. They have a plain himation draped over their hips and legs and a fillet decorated with leaves encircling their heads. The bearded men on the left and right *klinai* have their right arm drawn back across their chests, and each holds a stemless drinking cup. The youth in the central pair has put down his lyre to play *kottabos* with the stemless cup he is holding by the handle with his right index finger. His companion offers him a long white fillet. The youths on the left and right *klinai* have three small balls of clay above the fingers of their right hand. The *klinai* are spread with gaily patterned cushions. Before each *kline* is a low table laden with fruits and other assorted foods.

Stand. Top. Series of human and animal combats. A youth in a chlamys grasps a deer with long antlers by the muzzle and plunges his sword into its neck. He is flanked by scenes of griffins attacking Arimasps. The Arimasp at the right wears a chlamys, has a diadem adorned with leaves on his head, and is armed with a club in his right hand. The Arimasp at the left is dressed in oriental costume and has a sword in his raised right hand. His shield lies on the ground between his legs.

Beyond the right pair, a youth, perhaps Theseus, wrestles with a bull, forcing it down on its knees. A mantle slips off his body and a baldric crosses his chest diagonally.

Further right, two youths and a hunting dog pursue a hare by a tree. Each wears a chlamys, and the one on the right has a pilos on his head and a *lagobolon* (throwing stick used for hunting hares) in his left hand. The head of the youth at left is partially destroyed. His chlamys is wrapped around his left hand, and he has a spear in his outstretched right hand.

Base. Dionysiac scene. In the center Dionysos reclines on a *kline* covered with an elaborately decorated blanket. Like Adonis on the neck of side A, he props himself up on a cushion and has a richly patterned himation wrapped around his lower body and legs. His long curly hair is encircled with a fillet, and he holds a kantharos in his outstretched right hand. Eros stands at the left, holding torches and looking back to a pair of males who seem to approach the god rapidly arm in arm in the manner of komasts. The leader is young and beardless, and looks back at his companion who is older and bearded and wears a mantle that hangs from his right shoulder and left knee. He has long curly hair with a long fillet tied around it, and in his left hand he holds a lyre. His companion is dressed in an *ependytes*, a knee-length garment elaborately decorated with crosses and chevrons and a schematic version of a sea-monster border around the neck and lower border. A himation hangs from his shoulders. His long curly hair is bound with a long fillet, and he carries a torch in his right hand.

Five satyrs and four maenads complete the scene around the gods. Silenos, depicted aged with a hairy body, plays an aulos and follows the two revelers. Behind him, a maenad dances to the right in ecstacy, her head thrown back and her drapery swirling around her. She carries a thyrsos and a grapevine with two clusters in her left hand and a large *tympanon* in the right. She wears a belted peplos patterned around the neck and a himation over her left arm. It has slipped off her right shoulder and blows back as if it were an extension of her hair. A bracelet decorates her right arm.

Behind her, two satyrs with animal skins hanging from their shoulders converge on a maenad. The one at the left threatens the maenad with a thyrsos that he holds like a spear in his extended right hand. She defends herself with a thyrsos that she holds up in her right hand. She wears a belted peplos patterned around the neck, an animal skin hangs from her shoulders, and a leafed diadem sits around her head. The satyr at right reaches down for the hare that runs in front of him.

Behind the left satyr, a maenad runs right, looking back and holding a plate in her left hand and a thyrsos in the right. She wears a belted peplos that is patterned around the neck; her hair is tied in a *krobylos*, and she has bracelets on both arms. The dancing satyr behind her has an animal skin over his shoulders, holds a white *keras* (horn) in his left hand and extends his right arm.

The final group consists of two maenads dancing ecstatically who flank a satyr. The maenads, with heads thrown back, wear belted peploi patterned around the neck, and both have bracelets on their arms. The maenad on the right holds a himation behind her; the one at the left carries a thyrsos in her left hand. Between them, a satyr with a white animal skin draped from his shoulders moves to right looking back at the maenad behind him. He is bearded and balances a *tympanon* in his left hand.

The vase is one of the latest preserved Attic volute-kraters.

This combination of reeding and red-figure on Attic volute-kraters placed on stands was never popular, and most known examples date to the late fifth and fourth centuries B.C. Cf. two examples, both earlier than the Getty krater: (a) New York, Metropolitan Museum of Art, 24.97.35 (G. M. A. Richter and L. Hall, *The Metropolitan Museum of Art: Red-Figured Athenian Vases* [New Haven, 1936], pp. 161–63, no. 128 [“Leucippid Painter”]); (b) Ferrara, Museo Nazionale di Spina T.135 A VP, inv. 5081, attributed to the Painter of Athens 12255 ({{< q-abbr "*CVA*" >}} Ferrara 1 [Italy 37], pl. 13). The latter comes also from the workshop of the Meleager Painter and dates only a little earlier than the Getty krater. On the technique and its relation to metallic vessels, see {{< q-abbr "Schleiffenbaum, *Volutenkrater*" >}}, pp. 67, 73–80; N. Zimmermann, *Beziehungen zwischen Ton- und Metallgefässen spätklassischer und frühhellenistischer Zeit* (Leidorf, 1998); M. C. Miller, *Athens and Persia in the Fifth Century BC: A Study in Cultural Receptivity* (Cambridge, 1997), pp. 145–52; {{< q-abbr "Gaunt, “Attic Volute Krater”" >}}, pp. 306–20.

A chain of narrow, pointed leaves decorating shafts of handles is not common. Usually there is an ivy chain. For another example, cf. the volute krater contemporary to ours, by the Pronomos Painter, in Naples, Museo Archeologico Nazionale 3240 ({{< q-abbr "*ARV*<sup>2</sup>" >}} 1336.1; {{< q-abbr "*Beazley Addenda*<sup>2</sup>" >}} 365–66; M. Tiverios*, Archaia Aggeia* [Athens 1996], pp. 198–99, 333–35, figs. 181–82). Cf. also the wreath of olive leaves twisted in the center of the neck on the Pronomos krater to the wreath on the body of our krater. For myrtle as ornament in Attic vase-painting, see E. Kunze-Götte, *Myrte als Attribut und Ornament auf attischen Vasen* (Kilchberg, 2006).

The Getty krater bears similarities to Apulian red-figure kraters in a number of ways. Both have gilded heads, scrolls bridging handles with neck, and heads of African men, which correspond to the swans found on the Apulian vessels. See A. D. Trendall and A. Cambitoglou, *The Red-figured Vases of Apulia*, 2 vols. (Oxford, 1978–82).

Beobachtungen zur Rechteckkithara auf apulischen Vasen,” in {{< q-abbr "*Griechische Keramik im Kulturellen Kontext*" >}}, pp. 160–66.

Eros and Aphrodite are found on fourth-century representations of the gardens of Adonis; see {{< q-abbr "*LIMC*" >}}, vol. 1 (1981), pt. 1, pp. 227–28, s.v. “Adonis.” Adonis appears again with Eros and Aphrodite on a squat lekythos in New York 22.39.26 ({{< q-abbr "*LIMC*" >}}*,* vol. 1 [1981], pt. 1, pp. 227–28, no. 49, s.v. “Adonis”) but in a very different scene. Adonis scenes are found primarily on shapes with special relevance to women: hydriai, lekythoi, and a lebes gamikos (nuptial bowl).

For Dionysos in the works of the Meleager Painter and his circle, see {{< q-abbr "Kathariou, *Ergasterio Z. tou Meleagrou*" >}}, pp. 27–36.

Grypomachies with Orientals occasionally called Arimasps are a favorite subject on fourth-century Attic vases (see H. Metzger, *Les représentations dans la céramique attique du IVe siècle* [Paris, 1951], pp. 327–32). For the mythical battle between Arimasps and the griffins, known as early as the sixth century B.C. and especially from Aristeas of Prokonesos, see A. Ivantchik, “La datation du poème l’Arimaspées d’Aristéas de Proconnèse,” *L’Antiquité classique* 62 (1993): 35–67. The subject has been interpreted as symbol of the struggle for immortality and is seen partly as an attempt to appeal to the tastes of the Northern peoples who bought the Kerch vases. See E. H. Loeb, “Arimaspians and Griffins on an Attic Lekanis at the Israel Museum,” *Israel Museum Journal* 5 (1986): 67–72; Paul-Zinserling, *Der Jena-Maler und sein Kreis* (supra), pp. 106–12; X.

The two revelers approaching Dionysos on the stand have been identified as Apollo and Sabazios. See L. Burn, {{< q-abbr "*Greek Vases in the Getty* 5" >}}, p. 123. For Sabazios, see E. Simon, *Opfernde Götter* (Berlin, 1953), pp. 79–87; {{< q-abbr "Simms, “Foreign Religious Cults”" >}}, pp. 124–43; R. Gicheva, in {{< q-abbr "*LIMC*" >}}, vol. 8 (1997), pt. 1, pp. 1069–71, s.v. “Sabazios.”

The introduction of Sabazios to Dionysos by Apollo is not preserved in the literary sources, and no other depiction of it is known. {{< q-abbr "Simms, “Foreign Religious Cults”" >}}, pp. 281–82, has reservations for Sabazios’s cult in Athens before the late fourth century B.C. {{< q-abbr "Kathariou, *Ergasterio Z. tou Meleagrou*" >}}, pp. 28, 66, shows that the motif of the two figures leaning on each other is typical for the painter and his group. See also {{< q-abbr "Curti, *Pittore di Meleagro*" >}}, pp. 86–87. Cf. a column-krater by the Meleager Painter, once art market ({{< q-abbr "*ARV*<sup>2</sup>" >}} 1409.8 *bis*; {{< q-abbr "*Paralipomena*" >}} 490; {{< q-abbr "Kathariou, *Ergasterio Z. tou Meleagrou*" >}}, p. 214, no.
