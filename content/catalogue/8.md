## Comparanda

For the Triptolemos Painter, see [entry no. 21](/catalogue/21/) (86.AE.203). Thick brushing is characteristic of his work. Cf. a fragmentary amphora at the J. Paul Getty Museum, [85.AE.499.1](http://www.getty.edu/art/collection/objects/11588/), [85.AE.499.4](http://www.getty.edu/art/collection/objects/11591/), + [86.AE.194](http://www.getty.edu/art/collection/objects/11938/) ({{< q-abbr "*CVA*" >}} Malibu 7 [USA 32], pl. 329.2), depicting a warrior arming.

The figure is probably an athlete, either a diskos or javelin thrower, perhaps scraping himself with a strigil.
