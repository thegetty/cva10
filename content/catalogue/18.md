According to J. R. Guy, the fragment should be associated with the fragments in a private collection (formerly on loan to Princeton, lent by Ariel Herrmann), all belonging to a volute-krater with an Amazonomachy. The helmet on this fragment may belong to the right-hand Greek warrior depicted on that krater. For those volute-krater fragments, see {{< q-abbr "Robertson, *Art of Vase-Painting*" >}}, p. 58; J. M. Padgett, “Ancient Art,” in *In Celebration: Works of Art from the Collections of Princeton Alumni and Friends of the Art Museum, Princeton University*, ed. A. Rosenbaum (Princeton, 1997), p. 14, no. 11. Gaunt (supra) recognizes the scene as a Heraklean Amazonomachy.
