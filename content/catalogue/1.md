## Subject

Top of rim. A. Two pairs of a grazing deer and panther in black silhouette.

B. Two pairs of a grazing goat and panther in black silhouette.

Body. A. Two nude youths walking to right with their horses. They look at one another and each holds a *kentron* (goad) in his right hand.

B. Athletes training: a nude akontist (javelin thrower) on the left, a trainer (*paedotribēs*) in the center, and a nude jumper practicing with a pair of weights (*haltēres*) on the right. The akontist is presented in a three-quarter back view, moving to left while turning his head back toward the trainer. He holds his javelin horizontally in his right hand with his arm outstretched. A freestanding stick is fixed between the akontist and the trainer. The trainer, wearing a himation, stands to right, with his back to the viewer and his head turned left to watch the akontist. He holds a staff in his upraised right hand. The jumper stands to left with his right foot advanced and his arms outstretched in front, holding the *haltēres* in his hands. Behind and looking up at him, at the right, are the foreparts of a dog in profile. A sponge and a strigil hang at the upper right; a pick rests on the ground.

The column-krater is the favorite shape of Myson (see {{< q-abbr "*ARV*<sup>2</sup>" >}} 239–42, nos. 18–76; {{< q-abbr "*BAPD*" >}}, s.v. Myson; cf. [entry no. 2](/catalogue/2/) [73.AE.135]), and it has been suggested that he was one of the vase-painters responsible for reintroducing the shape into the Attic repertory (C. M. Cardon, “The Berlin Painter and His School” [Ph.D. diss., Institute of Fine Arts, New York University, 1977], p. 72; {{< q-abbr "Mannack, *Late Mannerists*" >}}, pp. 5, 50). The figural scenes are placed in panels as here or are unframed as in [entry no. 2](/catalogue/2/) (73.AE.135). For a similar scene and ornament as on A, cf. a column-krater by the same vase-painter in Boston, Museum of Fine Arts 1973.572 ({{< q-abbr "*ARV*<sup>2</sup>" >}} 1638.23 *bis*; {{< q-abbr "*Paralipomena*" >}} 349; {{< q-abbr "*Beazley Addenda*<sup>2</sup>" >}} 201; {{< q-abbr "Bron, “Chevaux et la danse,”" >}} pl. 6.2).

Figures in black silhouette occur more frequently on the overhang of the rim; cf. [entry no. 12](/catalogue/12/) (81.AE.161). For rims decorated on top with figures in black silhouette, see K. Schauenburg, “Silene beim Symposion,” {{< q-abbr "*JdI*" >}} 88 (1973): 1–26, esp. 14–20; {{< q-abbr "Mannack, *Late Mannerists*" >}}, p. 63.

Youths leading horses is a popular theme in Attic vase-painting, but it is difficult to be sure which representations are connected with sport and which are not. Given that the scene on side B depicts an athletic subject, it is possible that the horses on side A could be part of an athletic competition as well. Horses played a prominent role in the ancient Greek world, and Xenophon wrote a treatise *On Horsemanship* in the early fourth century B.C. For a similar scene, see the krater noted above in Boston, Museum of Fine Arts 1973.572, and a column-krater by the Flying-Angel Painter in a Lausanne private collection ({{< q-abbr "Bron, “Chevaux et la danse,”" >}} pl. 5). For a horse rendered in a similar way, cf. a column-krater in the manner of Myson in Berlin, Antikensammlung 31404 ({{< q-abbr "*ARV*<sup>2</sup>" >}}243.4; {{< q-abbr "*Beazley Addenda*<sup>2</sup>" >}} 202; {{< q-abbr "*CVA*" >}} Berlin, Antikensammlung 11 [Germany 86], pls. 5.2, 6.1).

Scenes of javelin throwing belong mainly to palaestra scenes and become common from the last quarter of the sixth century B.C. onward. See {{< q-abbr "Legakis, “Athletic Contests,”" >}} pp. 318–55, cat. no. 10; {{< q-abbr "Goossens, Thielemans, and Thas, “Sport Scenes,”" >}} pp. 65, 69, 73. For javelin throwing, see E. N.

Javelin throwing and jumping belong to the pentathlon. For the pentathlon, see [entry no. 2](/catalogue/2/) (73.AE.135).

The long jump appears frequently on Attic vases after the third quarter of the sixth century B.C. See {{< q-abbr "Goossens, Thielemans, and Thas, “Sport Scenes,”" >}} p. 75; {{< q-abbr "Legakis, “Athletic Contests,”" >}} pp. 276–317, cat. no. 9.

The *haltēres* depicted here are of the Archaic type used in the sixth and fifth centuries B.C. Cf. the *haltēres* on the column-kraters by Myson on Villa Giulia 984 (supra) and Villa Giulia 1044 (supra); the stone *haltēres* in Athens, National Museum 1926 ({{< q-abbr "*Mind and Body*" >}}, pp. 175–76, no. 66); a black-figure cup close to the Painter of Vatican G69 in Paris, Louvre CP 10376 ({{< q-abbr "*ABV*" >}} 210.3; {{< q-abbr "*CVA*" >}} Paris, Louvre 10 [France 17], pl. 107.3.8); a lekythos by the Bowdoin Painter in Athens, National Museum 17281 ({{< q-abbr "*ARV*<sup>2</sup>" >}} 684.145; {{< q-abbr "*CVA*" >}} Athens, National Museum 2 [Greece 2], pl. 12.6–7); a fragment of a kalpis by the Nikoxenos Painter in an English private collection ({{< q-abbr "*ARV*<sup>2</sup>" >}} 222.24; {{< q-abbr "Robertson, *Art of Vase-Painting*" >}}, p. 118, fig. 119).

For the trainer (*paedotribēs*), see {{< q-abbr "Kyle, *Athletics*" >}}, pp. 141–45.

Back views, introduced into vase-painting by the Pioneers, are often used by Myson. Cf. the akontists on the column-kraters Louvre CA 1947 (supra) and Villa Giulia 984 (supra); the *diskobolos* and *komast* on the column-krater Villa Giulia 1044 (supra); Herakles on the column-krater Florence 3981 (A. M. Esposito and G. de Tommaso, *Vasi Attici: Museo Archeologico Nazionale di Firenze Antiquarium* [Florence, 1993], p. 55, fig. 76). Cf. also the twisting poses and back views of the athletes in low relief on a kouros base in Athens, National Museum 3476 (A. Stewart, *Greek Sculpture* [New Haven, 1990], pp. 122–23, figs. 138–40); the boxer on the amphora by the Kleophrades Painter in Munich, Staatliche Antikensammlungen 2305 ({{< q-abbr "*ARV*<sup>2</sup>" >}} 121.3; {{< q-abbr "*CVA*" >}} Munich, Museum Antiker Kleinkunst 4 [Germany 12], pl. 173.1). For the back view of the trainer on B, cf. also the three-quarter back view of the middle *komast* on the amphora Type A by Euthymides in Munich, Staatliche Antikensammlungen 2307 ({{< q-abbr "*ARV*<sup>2</sup>" >}} 26.1, 1620; {{< q-abbr "*Agora* 30" >}}, p. 86). It is generally accepted that Myson learned to draw in the Pioneer workshop, and his vases recall Phintias, who may have been his master.

For nudity in ancient Greek athletics, see [entry no. 2](/catalogue/2/) (73.AE.135).

The hound appears to be fascinated by the athlete with the *haltēres*, and he attends the training carefully. Dogs, an important element in ancient Greek daily life, often appear in hunting scenes, but they also occur in palaestra, symposia, domestic or funeral contexts, and courtship scenes, without necessarily being an integral part of the composition or the narrative of the scene. It is during the late sixth and early fifth centuries B.C. that they reach the height of their popularity in vase-painting. Cf. a fragmentary volute-krater by the Syriskos Painter in Athens, National Museum ACR.758 ({{< q-abbr "*ARV*<sup>2</sup>" >}} 260.4; {{< q-abbr "*Mind and Body*" >}}, pp. 161–62, no. 47); a black-figure alabastron by the Theseus Painter in Palermo, Collezione Mormino 660 ({{< q-abbr "*CVA*" >}} Palermo, Collezione Mormino, Banco di Sicilia 1 [Italy 50], pl. 19.4–6); a pelike by the Triptolemos Painter in Malibu, J.
