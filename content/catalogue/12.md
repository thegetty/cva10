The right foot of the satyr at left disappears into the side frame.

For the iconography of the thiasos, see [entry no. 17](/catalogue/17/) (81.AE.188.7).

For satyrs pursuing maenads, see [entry no. 4](/catalogue/4/) (86.AE.207).

For the thyrsos, see F. G. Papen, *Der Thyrsos in der griechischen und römischen Literatur und Kunst* (Bonn, 1905); J. D. Beazley, ˝Narthex,˝ {{< q-abbr "*AJA*" >}} 37 (1933): 400–403. W. Burkert, in *Structure and History in Greek Mytholgy and Ritual* (Berkeley, 1979), p. 43, considers a thyrsos as a stylized form of the ritual branch and as a symbol demonstrating the power of Dionysos. For the association of thyrsos with semitic words meaning wine, see A. J. Frendo, “Phoenician Wine Could be Divine,” in *Actas del IV Congresso Internacional de Estudios Fenicios y Pýnicos, Cádiz, 2 al 6 de Octobre de 1995* (Cadiz, 2000), vol. 2, pp. 607–8 (with bibliography).
