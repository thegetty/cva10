Examples of two of the most distinctive and popular shapes of that period, column-kraters and volute-kraters, are gathered in this fascicule of the Corpus Vasorum Antiquorum, the tenth of the series devoted to the holdings of the J. Paul Getty Museum. These are large vessels, made for mixing wine and water at the symposium. The column-krater—called the “Corinthian krater” in antiquity—takes its modern name from the columnar supports at the rim. It was developed in Corinth by the end of the seventh century B.C. and soon adopted also by potters in Athens, where the shape is one of the most enduring. Volute-kraters are, in the words of Sir John Beazley, “the vase-shape which has more of the temple in it than any other.” Typically large, with high curling handles, these vases are often finely potted and present expansive fields for decoration. As with many pottery vessel shapes, the form also occurs in metal, and the Getty’s dinoid krater (87.AE.93; entry no. 24) offers a striking example of ceramicists emulating and elaborating upon that costlier medium.\nMost Athenian red-figure vase-painters seem to have specialized as either cup or pot painters, and the selection of vases and fragments gathered here has been attributed to many significant artists of the fifth century B.C., including Myson, the Pan Painter, the Kleophrades Painter, and Polygnotos. Iconographically, the kraters present a rich and engaging array of motifs and details. Notable is the recurrence of scenes of worship before altars and herms, images of devotion that would have been a central component of the lived experience of ancient Athenians. Besides these scenes of human activity, myths and heroic exploits continued to offer inspiration. Though fragmentary, the elaborate sack of Troy on Polygnotos’s volute-krater (79.AE.198; entry no. 23) demonstrates the ongoing interest in this subject, while the Kleophrades Painter’s krater (77.AE.11; entry no. 19) presents a mythological tour de force, with Peleus battling Thetis, three of Herakles’s Labors, and an extended Amazonomachy.\nThis catalogue marks a renewed commitment to publishing the Getty’s vase collection within the CVA, as the locus classicus of the field. It also marks a major shift forward, for this fascicule has been developed as an open-access digital publication with the option of print on demand. In publishing digitally, we maintain all of the respected and admired features of the CVA, now enhanced with the rich flexibility of free online access. We hope that this provides a model for future catalogues, and we are especially grateful to the American CVA Committee for supporting this initiative.\nThe volume has been many years in the making, and I congratulate its author, Despoina Tsiafakis, for bringing it to fruition. The project has had the ongoing support of the Getty’s Department of Antiquities, beginning with Marion True’s invitation and thereafter shepherded by David Saunders, Jens Daehner, and Kenneth Lapatin. The Department of Antiquities Conservation, particularly Jeffrey Maish, provided essential documentation, analysis, and conservation work. The vases have been newly photographed by Tahnee Cracchiola and Rebecca Truszkowski, and Toby Schreiber prepared the profile drawings. Sharon Herson copyedited the manuscript and Juliana Froggatt provided careful proofreading. Greg Albers, Rachel Barth, Michelle Woo Deemer, Kara Kirk, Ruth Evans Lane, Karen Levine, and Laura diZerega have been instrumental in developing the publication.\nTimothy Potts\nDirector\nThe J.

Paul Getty Museum. The volume contains the column- and volute-kraters, which range from 520 to 510 B.C. to the early fourth century B.C.; many are works of known potters and painters. Their presentation accords, in general, with the chronological sequence established by Sir John Beazley. The descriptions follow the format provided by the members of the USA CVA Committee, and attributions made by other scholars are credited under the heading ATTRIBUTION AND DATE. These vases have come to the Museum from a variety of sources, mostly from the art market. A number were part of the collection of Walter and Molly Bareiss. The origin of the vases, along with their known histories, is provided under the heading PROVENANCE. The last version of the complete manuscript was delivered in late 2013. Since then, some new bibliographic references have appeared and are included in the entries. Additions to the bibliography were made until 2015, with a few more in 2016 and 2017.\nThe Getty Museum’s coral-red volute-krater (84.AE.974) is not included in this volume. Ever since its acquisition in 1984, it has regularly been published as an exceptional instance of the use of coral-red on a large scale,1 but in 2013, Dyfri Williams and Jasper Gaunt contacted the Getty Museum with serious concerns about the vase’s authenticity. Their doubts were manifold, spanning the application and use of coral-red, the potting of the vessel, its overall decorative scheme and subsidiary ornament, and many aspects of style and iconography. Williams and Gaunt will discuss their concerns in a forthcoming study.2 Technical examinations are still being undertaken and will be published as soon as completed, but all parties have agreed that it is inappropriate to include the krater in this CVA.\nThe preparation of this volume began years ago, when I was invited by Dr. Marion True, curator of antiquities at that time, to undertake this project. I would like to thank her for trusting me with the material and for all her support. I studied the vases during two short visits, the last in 2003. The members of the Museum’s Department of Antiquities, however, were always most helpful to me, and I thank them for that. Jens Daehner and Kenneth Lapatin assisted me in various ways during the earlier years of this project, while in recent years David Saunders has been of tremendous help and a great source of information; I am very grateful to him for everything that he has done. Jeffrey Maish shared with me the results of his analysis of the coral-red krater (84.AE.974) and provided the measurements for many of the kraters in this volume. Karol Wight, Claire Lyons, and Jeffrey Spier facilitated in various practical issues regarding this publication, and Judith Barr provided some new references on the kraters.\nDuring the long process of preparing this CVA I was assisted also by many friends and colleagues in various ways. I thank Robert Guy for all his useful comments and for responding immediately to my attribution inquiries. Michael Padgett was always available to discuss any questions, and he provided a lot of information. Alan Shapiro furnished input and observations on iconography, while Michalis Tiverios made very constructive remarks on a much earlier version of this manuscript. I thank Jasper Gaunt, Ariel Hermann, An Jiang, Susan Matheson, Elizabeth Langridge Noti, and Dyfri Williams for photos, information, and discussions, and of course the CVA Committee—Guy Hedreen, Susan Matheson, Tyler Jo Smith, and John H. Oakley (chair)—for all their valuable comments, notes, and clarifications. They have contributed significantly to improving my manuscript. Any omissions or remaining errors are fully my responsibility.\nAnd finally, I would like to thank my son Dimitris for his patience and support; this volume is dedicated to him.\nDespoina Tsiafakis\nDirector of Research\nThe “Athena” Research \u0026amp; Innovation Center in Information, Communication \u0026amp; Knowledge Technologies,\nXanthi Department, Greece\n  Abbreviation: BAPDBeazley Archive Pottery Database. http://www.beazley.ox.ac.uk 16201; “Acquisitions/1984,” Abbreviation: GettyMusJThe J.

Given that the scene on side B depicts an athletic subject, it is possible that the horses on side A could be part of an athletic competition as well. Horses played a prominent role in the ancient Greek world, and Xenophon wrote a treatise On Horsemanship in the early fourth century B.C. For a similar scene, see the krater noted above in Boston, Museum of Fine Arts 1973.572, and a column-krater by the Flying-Angel Painter in a Lausanne private collection (Abbreviation: Bron, “Chevaux et la danse,”C.

The two figures that are rendered in similar poses with corresponding wreaths around their heads give the impression of the same theme at first sight, although their activities are quite distinct. It is interesting that the female is depicted on side A and the athlete on B, since side A is supposed to be the first seen by the viewer.\nMyson likes unframed scenes on column-kraters with single monumental figures of athletes, komasts, or naked women on each side. The black vase with little or no ornament and one or two figures on each side is the favorite of the late Archaic mode. See Abbreviation: ARV2J. D. Beazley. Attic Red-Figure Vase-Painters. 2nd ed.

It is usually depicted in the preparation for the sacrifice, and it carried holai (barleycorn), stemma (wreath), and machaira (single-edged sword), and sometimes popana (round cakes). Various images show the kanoun held in the hand of either a man or a woman, often beside an altar, in a ritual procession, or in a wedding context.

Because of the absence of any athletic activity on the vase, it is not clear whether the lebes on the pillar is an epathlon (prize) for a victory or a dedication in a sanctuary. The libation on A, suggestive of a sacred area, could also be related to an athletic victory, especially on account of the presence of the herm, which are common in athletic areas, such as a gymnasium or palaestra.

Robertson (Abbreviation: Robertson, Art of Vase-PaintingM. Robertson, The Art of Vase-Painting in Classical Athens. Cambridge, 1992, p. 145) says that “the Geras Painter was a miserable draughtsman, but the scenes on his little pelikai often have a character not unlike that of the Pan Painters’s (both have a thing about herms); and I am sure it does not violate chronological probability to see him in these as a crude imitator of the Pan Painter.”\nFor herms, see entry no. 6 (83.AE.252).\nThe boss on the side of the herm on entry no. 6 is black, while here it is a reserved square outlined in black; cf. also the boss on the herm on entry no. 9 (81.AE.37).

Aristophanes in Lysistrata (642–47) describes the kanephoros as the last religious role of an Athenian girl before marriage. This is mainly related to religious processions and consequently to scenes with similar iconography where the kanephoroi can be recognized as unmarried, but marriageable, young women. The presence of the herm is suggestive of a public space. The absence of an altar or a sacrificial animal could suggest that a bloodless sacrifice is depicted. For kanephoroi, see L. J.

Mannack. The Late Mannerists in Athenian Vase-Painting. Oxford, 2001.\nThe scene belongs to a series of so-called Lenaia vases, which date to the fifth century B.C. They represent women participating in a ritual involving wine and a cult image of Dionysos consisting of a bearded mask hung on a trunk or pillar. A garment wound about the column indicates the body, although there are no arms or legs. The scene has been associated with two Dionysian festivals, the Anthesteria and the Lenaia. The Lenaia vases are mostly stamnoi; the krater is not a common shape for this scene. The series of stamnoi starts with the Villa Giulia Painter and continues with his follower the Chicago Painter. Cf. two other Attic red-figure kraters with this theme, although the image is rendered in profile: a fragment from a volute-krater in Sydney, Nicholson Museum 56.33 (Abbreviation: Frontisi-Ducroux, Le dieu-masqueF.

Frickenhaus, Lenäenvasen, Winckelmannsprogramm der archäologischen Gesellschaft zu Berlin (BWPr) 72 (Berlin, 1912), and followed by L. Deubner, Attische Feste (Berlin, 1932). On the identification as the Anthesteria, see W. Burkert, Homo Necans: The Anthropology of Ancient Greek Sacrificial Ritual and Myth, trans. from the German by P. Bing (Berkeley, 1983), pp. 230–38. M. Dillon, in Girls and Women in Classical Greek Religion (London, 2002), pp. 149–52, comes to the same conclusion.\nFor a summary of the debate about the festive occasion for the cultic display of the image, see Abbreviation: Frontisi-Ducroux, Le dieu-masqueF. Frontisi-Ducroux. Le dieu-masque: Une figure du Dionysos d’Athènes. Images à l’appui 4.

Shapiro (New York, 2008), pp. 273–75, also recognizes the scene as the participation of woman in Dionysiac rituals. J. de la Genière, “Vases des Lénéennes?,” Mélanges de l’École française de Rome, Antiquité 99 (1987): 43–61, suggests that the subject was created for the Etruscan market.\nThe garment worn by the idol is unusual.

Despite its frequency, the subject is not well understood. It is not always clear whether the scene takes place inside or outside. Furthermore, it remains to be answered whether this space is intended to be public, sacred, or private. Such scenes are entitled “men and youths conversing,” but the cast of characters has led some scholars to suggest a conversation of erotic character.

Some joins, identified by An Jiang, are recorded below.\nSubject A. Upper zone: Amazonomachy (partially preserved). At left, an Amazon carrying a wounded or dead companion to left out of the battle. Behind them is preserved the edge of a helmet’s crest. Most of the rest of the left half of the scene is missing. Here should be placed the upper torsos of the two Amazons moving to left preserved on fragment 97.AE.58.2; they are mounted, as is indicated by the edge of the horse head preserved at the left end of the fragment and the thigh of the Amazon at the right. The latter is a hoplite, with a helmet on her head and a round shield and spear in her hands; the Amazon at the left is dressed in a Skythian costume and cap. The scene continues on 77.AE.11 with Telamonian Ajax (unnamed) in combat with Amazons occupying the center of the frieze. Ajax strides to left, dressed in a chitoniskos and armed with a round shield (bull as device), greaves, a corselet, and a Corinthian helmet with a low crest decorated with a double row of dots at the lower part. With his single-edged sword (machaira) he attacks a group of Amazons (two preserved) who confront him with spears. Next to Ajax stands Herakles in lionskin and chitoniskos, facing right. He grasps a fallen Amazon to deliver the final blow with his sword. A gorytos hangs at his side. The fallen Amazon wears a high-crested Attic helmet without decoration, holds a bow in her right hand, and grasps Herakles’s arm with the left hand. At the right, three pairs of fully armed Amazons move to the left to attack Herakles. The two Amazons at the far right are archers (98.AE.82.1 gives more of their legs and feet and the end of a quiver), the rest hoplites. One archer wears a Skythian cap; the rest of the Amazons wear greaves and helmets with crests decorated at their lower part with a double row of dots; the fallen Amazon and the first two attackers wear low-crested Attic helmets; the second pair and the first archer wear low-crested Chalcidian helmets. A centaur serves as the device on one Amazon’s round shield. The Amazon behind her holds a partially preserved Boiotian shield.\nInscriptions: KALO[S] to the right of the head of the Amazon carrying a companion. KALOS L[ between the heads of the standing Amazons attacking Ajax and Herakles.\nLower zone: The Labors of Herakles. The fragment 86.AE.587 should be placed on the left end of the figural frieze. It preserves the lower part of a female’s garment with the left foot standing to right, and the right foot of a figure to right. The female figure is probably Athena, standing behind her protegé Herakles, whose right foot can be recognized on the 86.AE.587 fragment and whose left foot is preserved on 77.AE.11. This is all that survives of the hero as he fights the Lernean Hydra, which is presented as a huge monster with nine snake heads; only four of the actual heads are fully or partially preserved, while the rest preserve only a part the snake’s body. Iolaos (partially preserved; 98.AE.82.4 gives his head) stands on the right facing the creature and prepares to cauterize the stumps of the severed necks with the torch he holds in his right hand. He wears a helmet and greaves and holds a spear and shield (device: Pegasos) in his left hand. Behind him, Herakles in a lionskin fights the triple-bodied Geryon (only the upper part of his shield, the lower leg with greaves, and three left feet are preserved) with his club (only lower end preserved) in his right hand. The double-bodied dog Orthros lies dead on the ground by Herakles’s and Iolaos’s feet. Blood pours from Orthros’s wound. Eurytion, the cowherd of Geryon, lies on the ground between the hero and Geryon, having been shot in the abdomen by an arrow. Blood pours from his wound. Following another lost section of the frieze is Athena (only her low-crested helmet, her left hand holding a shield, her legs from the knee down with the lower edges of her garment, and the end of a spear are preserved), who serves as a transitional element between this and the next labor. The goddess sits facing right, but looks back toward Geryon. In front of Athena to the right, Herakles (lionskin, gorytos) holds his club in his left hand while with his right he picks the golden apples of the Hesperides from the tree. The dragon Ladon (not fully preserved), represented as a three-headed snake coiled around the trunk, defends the tree. To the far right, as a figure to frame the figural scene, Atlas (partially preserved) stands frontally with right hand on his hip, probably holding the heavens on his shoulders.\nB. Upper zone: Amazons preparing for battle. All the Amazons wear chitoniskoi, greaves, and corselets, and all except for two on the left wear helmets, which are of either Attic or Chalcidian type. At left, five Amazons form two groups who test their weapons and begin to arm. The first Amazon testing her arrow serves as the framing device at the left end of the scene; she has a low-crested Chalcidian helmet on her head. Next to her, a companion facing left holds a Corinthian helmet, spear, and round shield (device: lion), and has her hair bound up in a krobylos, with a fillet around her head. The third Amazon also has her hair in a krobylos, with a fillet around it; she tests her spear, while her round shield and Corinthian helmet lie on the ground. Standing frontally while looking to her right, she is the transitional figure between the two pairs. The other two Amazons are arming. The fourth Amazon, with a Chalcidian helmet on her head, faces right (98.AE.82.3 provides a segment of her thighs and drapery), holding her round shield up before her (only the lower half depicted; device: legs of a running figure = triskeles), while the last, facing left, puts on her right greave and has an Attic helmet on her head (98.AE.82.6 preserves part of the helmet crest and a saltire square from the rim). In the center, three Amazons fully armed with two spears, shields, and helmets on their heads (the two on the right have Chalcidian helmets, while the third, at the rear, has an Attic helmet) calmly lead their horses to right; the lead one has a pelta (98.AE.82.2 proves a small part of the last horse’s tail). Another group of three fully armed Amazons move quickly to the right of the scene. Two of them are on foot and one leads a horse, all running toward a trumpeter. The Amazon leading the horse wears an Attic helmet, while the other two have Chalcidian helmets on their heads. The second Amazon carries a battle-axe in her right hand. The Amazon behind her holds a spear with her right hand and a round shield with her left. The trumpeter blows a salpinx, in the shape of a long, narrow cylindrical tube terminating in a bell (kodon). She is a hoplite with greaves, has a Chalcidian helmet on her head and a round shield on her left arm, and holds a spear in her left hand while facing left as the framing device at the right end of the scene.\nLower zone: Peleus seizing Thetis. At far left a woman, probably Doris, dressed in a chiton and himation, with her hair in a krobylos and a fillet, stands facing right and extending her right arm. Two Nereids dressed in chitons and himatia flee left to her with both feet off the ground while looking back at the abduction. The first Nereid has her golden hair down; the other wears hers in a krobylos and with a fillet. The second Nereid holds a small branch in her left hand. Cheiron, Peleus, and Thetis (partially preserved) are placed in the center of the composition. The centaur looks on from the left side, dressed in a himation and with a fillet around his head. He has human forelegs and carries a branch over his shoulder. Before him, Peleus wrestles with Thetis. The beardless hero’s hair is in a krobylos and fillet. A snake, one of Thetis’s metamorphoses, is coiled around his left leg. Thetis is in the grasp of Peleus. Part of her chiton is preserved with the lower part of her face looking left. Two Nereids dressed in chitons and himatia flee to Nereus on the right. The first (upper part of her head not preserved) runs with her feet off the ground as she looks back toward Thetis. She holds a fish in her left hand and pulls up her garment with the right so that she can run faster. The second Nereid also runs with both feet off ground, and extends her hands toward Nereus. Her hair is in a krobylos, and she wears a red fillet around her head. Nereus, the father of Thetis, is seated to left on a thakos (seat). Depicted as an old man with rounded shoulders, he is dressed in a chiton and himation, with a fillet around his head, and supports himself with a knobby staff with his right hand.\nAttribution and Date Attributed to the Kleophrades Painter by J.

The painter of this vase has also placed the figural decoration in two registers on the neck, leaving the body black, except for the zone with the black rays at the bottom of the body. Worthy of note is that the scenes with the abduction of Thetis by Peleus in the presence of Cheiron and with the arming of the Amazons are found on both vases and in the same registers.\nThe Kleophrades Painter divides all the scenes on the krater into triptychs, primarily using the “back to back” scheme. This seems to be characteristic of the painter; cf. a volute-krater once in Freiburg, art market (Kunst der Antike: Galerie Günter Puhze [Freiburg, 1983], cat. no. 5, p. 21, no. 189). Despite the limitations of space, he maintained his preference for narration. The miniaturist execution of the figures is of high quality and very carefully done. Except for the missing parts of the Amazonomachy on A, which does not allow for a full reconstruction, the rest of the scenes can be easily restored.\nFrontal figures such as Atlas are a common feature in the work of the Kleophrades Painter: cf. a pointed amphora in Munich, Staatliche Antikensammlungen NI 8732 (Abbreviation: ARV2J.

Worthy of note is that Ajax holds a machaira, a type of single-edged sword with a distinctive hooklike pommel designed for slashing rather than for stabbing. For the machaira, see A. Snodgrass, Arms and Armour of the Greeks (London, 1967), p. 97; F.

Oxford, 1997 (vol. 1), 2009 (vol. 2), 2014 (vol. 3), vol. 1, pp. 172–74, where the machaira is considered a “barbaric” weapon. In this case, it is strange that Ajax and not an Amazon holds the machaira. Ibid., p. 178, note 16, also mentions that the Kleophrades Painter is the earliest known to include the appropriate scabbard for the machaira. For the use of a machaira in the Amazonomachy, see P. Devambez, in Abbreviation: LIMCLexicon Iconographicum Mythologiae Classicae. 1981–2009, vol. 1 (1981), pt. 1, pp. 586–653, s.v. “Amazones.” The machaira is also found in the Gigantomachy; cf. a stamnos by the Tyszkiewicz Painter in London, British Museum E 443 (Abbreviation: ARV2J.

Oxford, 1963 292.29; Abbreviation: CVACorpus Vasorum Antiquorum London 3 [Great Britain 4], pl. 21.3).\nThe preparation for battle of the Amazons on side B could be recognized as the scene before the battle depicted on A. This is also supported by the salpinx, which was blown before or after battle.\nFor the salpinx, see S. Michailidis, Enkyklopaideia tēs archaias hellēnikēs mousikēs (Athens, 1982), pp. 278–79; M.

Manakidou (Thessaloniki, 2014), pp. 257–70.\nThe salpinx is mainly a warlike instrument with a military use—for example, to signal the beginning of a battle, which in our case is depicted on the other side of the krater. Moreover, the salpinx gave cavalry signals (Xenophon, Hipparch. 3.12), something that also coincides with the depicted scene. In Attic vase-painting it is found mostly in battle scenes and less often in Dionysiac contexts, rituals, and athletics (see Neils, “‘Bronze-Belled Braying’” [supra], pp. 258–66). Trumpeting Amazons are found in Late Archaic Athenian iconography; cf. a red-figure hydria by Hypsis in Munich, Staatliche Antikensammlungen 2423 (Abbreviation: ARV2J. D. Beazley.

A scholion to the Theogony adds that Alkaios (443 frg.) gave her nine heads (see fragments of Sappho and Alkaios cited according to E. Lobel and D. L. Page, Poetarum lesbiorum fragmenta [Oxford, 1955]). The nine-headed Hydra is found in several literary sources (Apollodorus, Bibliotheca 2.5.2; Hyginus, Fabulae 151; Suda, s.v. “Hydra”) and is common in representations throughout the fifth century B.C. During this period the Hydra is normally shown with nine or seven heads, with some exceptions that vary from three to eleven heads (see G. Kokkorou-Alewras, “Herakles and the Lernean Hydra” [supra], pp. 42–43). For the chronological appearance of literary sources regarding the myth, see Gantz, Early Greek Myth (supra), pp. 384–86. For Herakles’s labor with the Hydra, see also Abbreviation: CVACorpus Vasorum Antiquorum Basel, Antikenmuseum 1 (Switzerland 4), pp. 41–43, pl. 11.10–13; P. Amandry and D.

The placement of Herakles to the left of the Hydra with Iolaos to the right is typical. Iolaos is shown as a hoplite in Archaic black-figure vase-painting: cf. a Tyrrhenian amphora by the Castellani Painter, once on the art market in Rome (Abbreviation: ABVJ. D. Beazley.

Milan, 1991, pp. 199–204, cat. no. 41), depicting the scene with the involvement of the same figures (Herakles, Geryon, Orthros, Eurytion). The version of Eurytion being killed while asleep is rare (cf. the representations in E. Zervoudaki, “Eurytion II” [supra], pp. 112–17). Based on Eurytion’s posture, perhaps this is the case here; this might be an innovation of the Kleophrades Painter.\nExcept for the number of the heads, Ladon is depicted almost like the Hydra. Normally Ladon has one head; three heads is very rare. For another example, cf. a hydria in Paris, Abbreviation: Cab. Méd.Cabinet des Médailles, Paris 4820 (J. D. Beazley, Attische Vasenmaler des rotfigurigen Stils [Tübingen, 1925], p. 320, no. 17 [attributed to the Amymone Painter]).

The image of Herakles picking the apples on his own is not common in Attic red-figure; for other examples, see Kokkorou-Alewras, “Herakles and the Hesperides” (supra), pp. 102–3.\nPegasos is a trademark on the Kleophrades Painter’s shields, particularly on the Panathenaic amphorae.

The depiction of the theme on a volute-krater is extremely rare in Attic vase-painting (for another example, see the black-figure volute-krater in Munich, Staatliche Antikensammlungen 1740 [supra]); see Vollkommer, “Peleus” (supra), pp. 255–69.

The scene belongs to Krieger’s “Umklammerungstypus” (the struggle type), which dominates the extant Attic representations of the subject. Cf. also two other vases by the Kleophrades Painter depicting the subject: a fragmentary red-figure stamnos in Malibu, J. Paul Getty Museum 81.AE.220 (Abbreviation: Barringer, Divine EscortsJ. M.

Anne Arbor, Mich., 1995, p. 194, no. 132).\nThe symmetrical arrangement with three figures on each end of the scene moving away from the central group highlights the setting with the struggling couple and Cheiron. The composition with the two protagonists wrestling in the center and flanked by Cheiron to the left and a fleeing Nereid to the right is found on a black-figure belly-amphora, Munich 1415.WAF near the Leagros Group (Abbreviation: Barringer, Divine EscortsJ. M. Barringer. Divine Escorts: Nereids in Archaic and Classical Greek Art. Anne Arbor, Mich., 1995, pl. 71). The centaur is again depicted with human forelegs and holds a branch over his shoulder. The similarity extends to the Nereid who is fleeing to the right while looking back toward Thetis and holding her garment with her right hand. This arrangement with Cheiron standing next to the couple is found primarily in black-figure, whereas in red-figure he is usually placed farther away (for another exception, see a hydria in Münzen und Medaillen Sonderliste N [Basel, 1971]: 15, no. 10). For Attic vases depicting Cheiron in the scene, see Vollkommer, “Peleus” (supra), pp. 256, 261–63; Gisler-Huwiler, “Cheiron” (supra), pp. 239–40. For Cheiron, see also M. Vogel, Chiron der Kentaur mit der Kithara (Bonn, 1978).\nCentaurs from Geometric and Archaic times are normally depicted as ordinary men with human feet and the rear end of a horse grafted on.

A suggestion that he is Oinopion, son of Dionysos, is possible, especially because of his appearance in symposion scenes with Dionysos. Cf. the poros pediment from Corfu, in ibid., p. 456, no. 370, depicting Dionysos reclining with a youth, maybe Oinopion. For Oinopion, see O.

Thiasos with six satyrs and five maenads runs around the neck interrupted, by the handles. On A, three pairs of satyrs and maenads. The maenad on the left is dressed in a chiton and himation, and moves to left looking back at a satyr. A feline is perched on her extended left arm and hand. The nude satyr who pursues her carries a full wineskin over his shoulder and a forked stick in his right hand. Behind him, a maenad dressed in a belted peplos chases a satyr to the right. She holds a forked stick horizontally in her right hand, and a leopard skin is draped over her extended left arm and pinned at her right shoulder. Before her a nude satyr, in three-quarter back view, looks back while moving to the right and holding out a wineskin in his right hand. A fillet hangs above in the background. The third pair consists of a maenad, dressed in a belted peplos, who moves to the right toward a satyr who bends over to right with a leopard skin draped across his back. A kantharos hangs suspended in the field above him. The maenad has teardrop earrings and swings a thyrsos at the satyr, who scampers off on all fours. Like her counterpart in the central pair, she has a leopard skin draped over her extended left arm. Each maenad has her hair tied up in a krobylos. There are no real framing figures on this side, giving the impression that the scene continues on side B.\nB. Three satyrs with two maenads between them. The two satyrs at the two ends may serve as framing figures indicating the ends of the scene. On the left, a nude satyr (face missing) facing right moves to the right with a torch in his left hand. A maenad before him, wearing a chiton and carrying a thyrsos(?) (upper end not preserved) over her left shoulder, runs to the right. She has thrown her head back in song or ecstasy. The satyr in the middle, facing left, approaches a pointed amphora lying before him. Behind him another maenad runs to the left, looking back at the satyr who pursues her. She is dressed in a peplos and carries a lighted torch in each hand. Her hair is tied up in a krobylos and is decorated with a diadem. At the right end of the scene stands a thyrsos with a kantharos suspended above it.\nBody. A. Ilioupersis. Ajax and Kassandra. Only the upper parts of the figures are preserved. The Palladion, dressed in a peplos and armed with an Attic helmet, a spear, and a shield, stands frontally in the center of the scene. Athena (only her head is preserved) stands to the right of the statue, facing left and wearing an Attic helmet. Kassandra (only her head is preserved), wearing a dotted band with three upright leaves around her head, sits or kneels at the feet of the statue. Ajax (the upper part of his body and head are preserved, but his face is missing) reaches for Kassandra with his right hand. He is bearded, wears a low-crested Corinthian helmet pushed back on his head, and has a himation slung over his right shoulder. The round shield on his left arm is shown in a three-quarter view from the inside, and is decorated with a four-pointed star. Behind him on the left, a female attendant or priestess (upper part of the body and head preserved) stands to the right. Dressed in a chiton and wearing a disk earring, she has her hair tied up in a krobylos and carries on her head a chest decorated with a red rosette and tendrils.\nAIAS (retrograde) is written to the right of his helmet.\nKA[SSANΔΡΑ] is written starting at the right of Ajax’s helmet and continuing above Kassandra.\nAΘΕΝΑ is between the heads of the two Athenas.\nThe inscription MENE [LAOS] behind Athena’s head indicates his presence.\nA group of three letters on the neck (E the last at right) is near the wreath between a satyr and a maenad on A.\nAttribution and Date Attributed to Polygnotos by J.

Cambitoglou, The Red-figured Vases of Apulia, vol. 1 [Oxford, 1978], p. 193.8; Touchefeu, “Aias II” (supra), pp. 343–44, no. 59).\nFor the identification of the fleeing female as a priestess, see T.

Mantis (pp. 24–28, 76) does not recognize as priestesses the women with sacrificial baskets or boxes and suggests that they are simply kanephoroi or maids. The mythical priestess of Athena in Troy is known as Theano, and she appears in several representations. For depictions of Theano, see Mantis (supra), pp. 72–80; Abbreviation: Moret, IlioupersisJ.-M.

Valavanis and E. Manakidou, pp. 289–302. Thessaloniki, 2014 pp. 289–302). The motif of the female fleeing to the left and looking back with an object on her head at the left side of the scene seems to be typical of the Polygnotan Group for the subject. In addition to the Getty krater, it is found on the krater in Taranto, Museo Nazionale T11 (supra), where the woman is depicted behind Theano, and on the neck-amphora in Cambridge, Fitzwilliam Museum, Lewis Loan 103.22 (supra), where the woman has a footstool above her head.\nFor various types of boxes in antiquity, see E.

Paul Getty Museum; according to Museum documentation at the time of acquisition, this vase is “ex Swiss Private collection,” but this information has not been verified.\nShape and Ornament Top of rim is black. Outside of rim on A and B is decorated with an Ionic kymation above a double palmette and lotus chain with relief dots in the palmette hearts and between the spiraling tendrils on A and a larger upright palmette and lotus chain on B. An astragalos in relief runs along the molding between the rim and the neck on both sides. A “rope” pattern runs around the neck and body on both sides.\nUpper neck. Zone of ivy vine in relief on A; myrtle wreath with berries between each pair of leaves on B.\nHandles rise from the heads of four African men placed on the shoulder. Curling S-shaped scrolls with buds or leaves attached bridge the handles and the neck. The upper terminals of the volutes are masked with concave disks decorated with gilded frontal female heads in relief in the center; around the heads, a frame is formed by five encircled palmettes, each rendered with a raised heart. The roundels of the volutes of the handles are ringed by red chains of myrtle leaves with berries between each pair of leaves. The same leaf chain runs along the outer flanges of the handles. A reserved strip is visible on the sides of the handles.\nThe body, squat and round like a dinos, is black, and decorated with vertical ribbing with even arches at the top. A smooth band above the widest circumference interrupts the ribbing and is decorated with a wreath of olive leaves and fruits interspersed, rendered in clay relief; the ends of the wreath are twisted together in the center of side A, just below the principal figure scene. The ribbing on the body ends shortly above the base, below which is a notched ridge. The walls of the vase draw to a projecting ring instead of a foot, which was used to place the vessel securely upon its separate stand. The stand should originally have had a stem with an upper resting surface (now a modern reconstruction) for the rounded bottom of the vase. The stand is divided into two parts. The upper part is decorated with a short Ionic kymation set between notched ridges. The figural scene is set between an Ionic kymation and a palmette and lotus chain; a notched ridge divides the two parts. A broad zone with long black-glaze tongues runs around the lower part of the stand. Ionic kymation; notched edge. Resting surface and underside of stand reserved.\n                     View all profiles ↗  Subject Neck. A. Adonis and Aphrodite. The hero reclines facing left on a klinē covered with a fringed and elaborately embroidered blanket at the center of the scene. He is propped up on cushions, with a richly patterned himation draped over his lower body and legs; his upper body, nude, plump, and soft-looking, is missing the head, but his long hair can be seen in the curls running down over the left shoulder and breast; both his hands are raised to bind a fillet around his head. Eros crouches on the left end of the klinē, and offers Adonis some round objects rendered in relief (fruits?) with his right hand; he holds a plate in his left with similar objects (two, on each side of the plate, are rendered in relief, and the four in the middle as white dots). Eros is nude, with long, curly hair and a fillet around his head. A low table or footstool with two round objects (fruits?) lies in front of the klinē. At the left end of the scene, Aphrodite sits on a chest by the feet of Adonis, as two women (attendants?) stand behind her. The goddess, presented in three-quarter view, is dressed in a finely pleated, diaphanous chiton that slips off her left shoulder and an elaborately patterned himation that is wrapped around her legs. Her hair is pulled back in a chignon, and she wears bracelets and a necklace. She looks back to the standing women, which, combined with the gesture of her left hand, suggests that she is engaged in conversation. The woman directly behind the goddess raises her hands toward Aphrodite. She is dressed in a finely pleated, diaphanous chiton and a plain himation pulled up over her head. Like the goddess, she has her hair pulled back in a chignon, and she wears a bracelet, earrings, and a necklace, as well as a diadem adorned with leaves on her head. A third woman stands at the left end of the scene, facing right. She is dressed in a chiton similar to those of the other two, and has a plain mantle wrapped around her left arm and lower body. Her left foot rests atop a chest, and she looks in a mirror that she holds in her left hand; in her raised right hand she holds a string of beads, with which she prepares to adorn herself.\nAnother trio of women flanks the right side of Adonis’s bed. A second goddess, most likely Persephone, is seated on a chest flanked by her companions. She wears a finely pleated, diaphanous chiton, which slips off her right shoulder, and an elaborately decorated himation around her legs. Persephone gestures with the mirror that she holds up in her right hand and faces left. She wears bracelets and earrings. Behind her, a companion stands facing left and leaning with her right arm on Persephone’s shoulder. She, too, is dressed in a finely pleated diaphanous chiton, which slips off her right shoulder, but she has a plain himation. Her hair is tied back with a band, and she wears a bracelet, a necklace, and earrings. In front of Persephone, a woman dances. She wears a chiton similar to those of the others, a necklace, earrings, and a diadem, and a long, richly patterned himation covers most of her body and the back of her head. Her hands appear to rest on her waist, and her head is presented in a three-quarter view as she looks back at Persephone.\nB. Symposion. Three pairs of banqueters recline on three klinai. Each pair consists of a young, beardless man and an older, bearded one engaged in conversation. All six figures are rendered in similar poses, with their left elbows propped at the same angle on a cushion and their legs to the left. All the youths, the left figure in each pair, turn their heads to the right to look at their older partner. All the figures are partially nude, with their upper bodies exposed. They have a plain himation draped over their hips and legs and a fillet decorated with leaves encircling their heads. The bearded men on the left and right klinai have their right arms drawn back across their chests, and each holds a stemless drinking cup. The youth in the central pair has put down his lyre to play kottabos with the stemless cup he is holding by the handle with his right index finger. His companion offers him a long white fillet. The youths on the left and right klinai have three small balls of clay above the fingers of their right hands. The klinai are spread with gaily patterned cushions. Before each klinē is a low table laden with fruits and other assorted foods.\nTop of base. Series of human and animal combats. A youth in a chlamys grasps a deer with long antlers by the muzzle and plunges his sword into its neck. He is flanked by scenes of griffins attacking Arimasps. The Arimasp at the right wears a chlamys, has a diadem adorned with leaves on his head, and is armed with a club in his right hand. The Arimasp at the left is dressed in Eastern costume and has a sword in his raised right hand. His shield lies on the ground between his legs.\nBeyond the right pair, a youth, perhaps Theseus, wrestles with a bull, forcing it down on its knees. A mantle slips off his body, and a baldric crosses his chest diagonally.\nFarther right, two youths and a hunting dog pursue a hare by a tree. Each wears a chlamys, and the one on the right has a pilos on his head and a lagobolon (throwing stick used for hunting hares) in his left hand. The head of the youth at left is partially lost. His chlamys is wrapped around his left hand, and he has a spear in his outstretched right hand.\nAround the base. Dionysiac scene. In the center Dionysos reclines on a klinē covered with an elaborately decorated blanket. Like Adonis on the neck of side A, he props himself up on a cushion and has a richly patterned himation wrapped around his lower body and legs. His long, curly hair is encircled with a fillet, and he holds a kantharos in his outstretched right hand. Eros stands at the left, holding torches and looking back to a pair of males who seem to approach the god rapidly, arm in arm in the manner of komasts. The leader is young and beardless, and looks back at his companion, who is older and bearded. The leader wears a mantle that hangs from his right shoulder and left knee. He has long, curly hair, with a long fillet tied around it, and in his left hand he holds a lyre. His companion is dressed in an ependytēs, a knee-length garment, elaborately decorated with crosses and chevrons and a schematic version of a sea-monster border around the neck and lower border. A himation hangs from his shoulders. His long, curly hair is bound with a long fillet, and he carries a torch in his right hand.\nFive satyrs and four maenads complete the scene around the gods. Silenos, depicted aged and with a hairy body, plays an aulos and follows the two revelers. Behind him, a maenad dances to the right in ecstacy, her head thrown back and her drapery swirling around her. She carries a thyrsos and a grapevine with two clusters in her left hand and a large tympanon in the right. She wears a belted peplos patterned around the neck and a himation over her left arm. It has slipped off her right shoulder and blows back as if it were an extension of her hair. A bracelet decorates her right arm.\nBehind her, two satyrs with animal skins hanging from their shoulders converge on a maenad. The one at the left threatens the maenad with a thyrsos that he holds like a spear in his extended right hand. She defends herself with a thyrsos that she holds up in her right hand. She wears a belted peplos patterned around the neck, an animal skin hangs from her shoulders, and a leafed diadem sits around her head. The satyr at right reaches down for the hare that runs in front of him.\nBehind the left satyr, a maenad runs right, looking back and holding a plate in her left hand and a thyrsos in the right. She wears a belted peplos that is patterned around the neck, her hair is tied in a krobylos, and she has bracelets on both arms. The dancing satyr behind her has an animal skin over his shoulders, holds a white keras (horn) in his left hand, and extends his right arm.\nThe final group consists of two maenads dancing ecstatically who flank a satyr. The maenads, with heads thrown back, wear belted peploi patterned around the neck, and both have bracelets on their arms. The maenad on the right holds a himation behind her; the one at the left carries a thyrsos in her left hand. Between them, a satyr with a white animal skin draped from his shoulders moves to right, looking back at the maenad behind him. He is bearded and balances a tympanon in his left hand.\nAttribution and Date Attributed to the vase-painters M1 (neck) and M2 (stand), formerly known as one vase painter, the Meleager Painter, by K.

La bottega del pittore di Meleagro. Rome, 2001, also suggests two vase-painters and renders the neck to the Meleager Painter and the stand to the A 1 painter.\nThe vase is one of the latest preserved Attic volute-kraters. The combination of reeding and red-figure on the shape was never popular, and most known examples date to the late fifth and fourth centuries B.C. Cf. two examples, both earlier than the Getty krater: New York, Metropolitan Museum of Art 24.97.35 (G. M. A. Richter and L. Hall, The Metropolitan Museum of Art: Red-Figured Athenian Vases [New Haven, 1936], pp. 161–63, no. 128 [“Leucippid Painter”]); and Ferrara, Museo Nazionale di Spina T.135 A VP, inv. 5081, attributed to the Painter of Athens 12255 (Abbreviation: CVACorpus Vasorum Antiquorum Ferrara 1 [Italy 37], pl. 13). The latter also comes from the workshop of the Meleager Painter and dates to only a little earlier than the Getty krater. On the technique and its relation to metallic vessels, see Abbreviation: Schleiffenbaum, VolutenkraterH. E. Schleiffenbaum.

Usually there is an ivy chain. For another example, cf. the volute-krater contemporary to ours, by the Pronomos Painter, in Naples, Museo Archeologico Nazionale 3240 (Abbreviation: ARV2J. D. Beazley.

Los Angeles, 2006 pp. 106–17.\nThere are a number of similarities between the Getty krater and Apulian red-figure kraters—the gilded heads, the scrolls bridging the handles with the neck, and the heads of African men, which correspond to the swans often found at the handles on the Apulian vessels.

Adonis appears again with Eros and Aphrodite on a squat lekythos in New York, Metropolitan Museum of Art 22.39.26 (ibid., pp. 227–28, no. 49) but in a very different scene.

Metzger, Les représentations dans la céramique attique du IVe siècle [Paris, 1951], pp. 327–32). For the mythical battle between Arimasps and griffins, known as early as the sixth century B.C. and especially from Aristeas of Prokonesos, see A. Ivantchik, “La datation du poème l’Arimaspée d’Aristéas de Proconnèse,” L’Antiquité classique 62 (1993): 35–67. The subject has been interpreted as a symbol of the struggle for immortality and is seen partly as an attempt to appeal to the tastes of the Northern peoples who bought the Kerch vases. See E. H.
