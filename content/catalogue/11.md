## Subject

A. Four mantled youths in conversation, in pairs. At left a youth (upper body and head missing) leans on his stick to right facing his partner (lower body and feet preserved). Next to him, in the middle of the scene a youth stands to right in a relaxed position, leaning on his short stick, a wreath around his head. His right arm is akimbo, and he gestures with the fingers of his left hand in front of his mouth as if he is talking. Before him a young man with a fillet around his head listens, supporting himself with the staff that he holds in his right hand. His staff and left foot extend into the frame.

Behind the head of the second youth from right: [K] ALOS.

78.AE.380.36: the fragment preserves the lower face, chin, neck, and shoulder of a male figure. It should belong to the youth second from the left.

B. Three draped youths in conversation. At left stands a youth (right arm and lower part of the body missing) facing right, holding a torch in his raised left hand; he wears a fillet around his head. The middle youth, heavily draped, talks to the young man at right. The latter, also with a fillet around his head, holds a flower up between the fingers of his right hand in front of his face. His left hand rests on the staff that he leans upon.

## Comparanda

The Agrigento Painter is one of the earlier Mannerists. For the Agrigento Painter, see {{< q-abbr "*ARV*<sup>2</sup>" >}} 566, 574–79, 586, 1659–60; {{< q-abbr "*Paralipomena*" >}} 391–92; {{< q-abbr "*Beazley Addenda*<sup>2</sup>" >}} 262; {{< q-abbr "Robertson, *Art of Vase-Painting*" >}}, p. 149; {{< q-abbr "*Agora* 30" >}}, pp. 106–7; {{< q-abbr "Mannack, *Late Mannerists*" >}}, pp. 17–19.

The column-krater is a favorite shape of the painter and the most favored shape of the red-figure Mannerists. For the shape of the column-krater used by the Agrigento Painter, see {{< q-abbr "Mannack, *Late Mannerists*" >}}, p. 52. Cf. another column-krater by the Agrigento Painter in New Haven, Yale University 1933.175 ({{< q-abbr "*ARV*<sup>2</sup>" >}} 576.45; S. Matheson Burke and J. J. Pollitt, *Greek Vases at Yale* [New Haven, 1975], pp. 61–63, no. 53; {{< q-abbr "*CVA*" >}} Yale University Art Gallery 1 [USA 38], pl. 12–13), with draped figures on both sides. This seems to be a favorite subject for the Agrigento Painter, who used it to decorate both sides of other vessels: a pelike in St. Petersburg, Hermitage B2343 ({{< q-abbr "*ARV*<sup>2</sup>" >}} 578.74; {{< q-abbr "*Paralipomena*" >}} 513); a pelike in Paris, Musée National Rodin TC 4 ({{< q-abbr "*ARV*<sup>2</sup>" >}} 578.75; {{< q-abbr "*CVA*" >}} Musée National Rodin [France 16], pl. 21.3.4); two pelikai once on the art market ({{< q-abbr "*ARV*<sup>2</sup>" >}} 578.76; {{< q-abbr "*ARV*<sup>2</sup>" >}} 578.77); a kalpis in Rhodes, Archaeological Museum 12266 ({{< q-abbr "*ARV*<sup>2</sup>" >}} 579.88; {{< q-abbr "*ClRh*" >}} 4, 210, 211, fig. 224).

Mantled youths start to appear frequently on the back of kraters just after the mid-fifth century B.C. and continue to do so until the end of Attic red-figure. Despite its frequency, the subject is not well understood. It is not always clear whether the scene takes place inside or outside. Furthermore, it remains to be answered whether this space is intended to be public, sacred, or private. Such scenes are entitled “men and youths conversing,” but the cast of characters has led some scholars to suggest a conversation of erotic character. See V. Sabetai, in *Athenian Potters and Painters, Catalogue of the Exhibit, December 1, 1994–March 1, 1995, Gennadius Library, American School of Classical Studies* (Athens, 1994), p. 38, no. 25; {{< q-abbr "Fehr, “Ponos and the Pleasure of Rest”" >}}, in {{< q-abbr "*Archaeology of Representations*" >}}, pp. 132–41.

For similar scenes, cf. a cup by the Painter of the Paris Gigantomachy, now in a London private collection, once in the Hearst Collection ({{< q-abbr "*ARV*<sup>2</sup>" >}} 421.83; I. Raubitschek, *The Hearst Hillsborough Vases* [Mainz, 1969], pp. 59–62, no. 15). For the subject, see also M. Langner, “Mantle-figures and the Athenization of Late Classical Imagery,” in S. Schierup and B. Bundgaard Rasmussen, eds., *Red-figure Pottery in Ancient Setting. Acts of the International Colloquium Held at the National Museum of Denmark in Copenhagen, November 5–6, 2009* (Aarhus, 2012), pp. 11–20; M. Franceschini, “Mantled and Naked Figures in Attic Red-Figure Pottery,” Appendix in M. Harari, “Out of the Tondos. The Outside of the Clusium Cups: An Iconographic Reconsideration,” in V. Sabetai and S. Schierup, eds., *The Regional Production of Red-figure Pottery: Greece, Magna Graecia & Etruria* (Aarhus, 2014), pp. 298–301.

On draped figures, see generally H. G. Hollein, *Bürgerbild und Bildwelt der attischen Demokratie auf den rotfigurigen Vasen des 6.-4. Jahrh. v. Chr.* (Frankfurt, 1988).

The enveloping mantle is usually worn by females and boys, and it might be interpreted as a visual metaphor of *aidos*. See G. Ferrari, “Figures of Speech: The Picture of Aidos,” *Metis* 5 (1990): 185–200.
