## Provenance

–1979, Malcolm Wiener (Greenwich, Connecticut); 1979, donated to the J. Paul Getty Museum; these were part of a group of fourteen miscellaneous Greek and South Italian fragments. Following a collaborative research project, seven of these fragments were identified as coming from Francavilla Marittima and deaccessioned (see further, F. van der Wielen-van Ommeren and L. de Lachenal, eds., *La dea di Sibari e il santuario ritrovato: Studi sui rinvenimenti dal Timpone Motta di Francavilla Marittima*, vols. 1.1 and 1.2 [Rome, 2007–8]). The fragments that were not associated with the site—including these two—remain in the collection.
