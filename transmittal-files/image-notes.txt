## ImageMagick Commands

Convert high resolution TIFs to JPGs that are 1800px on their longest side, or their original size if already smaller than 1800px:

convert /path/to/images/on/server/* -quality 60% -resize '1800x1800>' -set filename:name "%t" GitHub/cva10/static/img/objects/%[filename:name].jpg


Pull caption metadata from high resolution TIFs and save along with file name in a standalone TXT file:

magick identify -set filename:name "%t" -format "%[filename:name].jpg; %[comment]\n" /path/to/images/on/server/* >> images.txt
